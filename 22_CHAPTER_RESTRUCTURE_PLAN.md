## ACT STRUCTURE VERIFICATION

**ACT I (Ch 1-5):** 13,000 words ✓
- Ordinary world established
- Call to adventure
- Refusal (internal)
- Meeting mentor
- Crossing threshold (committing to training)

**ACT II (Ch 6-14):** 24,000 words ✓

- Rinzen's death (preview)
- Final preparations
- Climactic battle (AGI emergence)
- Resolution (success)
- Epilogue (both worlds continuing)

**EMOTIONAL ARC:**
- Lifan: Acceptance → Doubt → Recommitment → Dissolution → Transcendence
- Nydan: Denial → Breakthrough → Bargaining → Acceptance → Continuation
- Niguma: Walls → Cracking → Opening → Love → Motherhood
- ROHKI: Confusion → Worry → Grief → Memorial → Understanding → Creation

**PACING VERIFIED:**

- Cliffhangers: 35%+ page-turners
- External stakes present throughout Act II
- No sagging middle (compressed training, added Marcus)

This structure delivers on all editorial requirements while integrating the Rohki/LA thread as Lifan's "ordinary world" that makes the sacrifice devastating and the victory meaningful.
