CONVERGENCE PRACTICE (KARMAMUDRA) - DETAILED

What it actually is:
- Sexual union as advanced meditation technique
- Combining physical intimacy with consciousness practices
- Generates intense bliss-state
- Used to directly perceive emptiness/non-duality
- Requires:
  * Complete mastery of Inner Fire
  * Understanding of subtle body
  * Proper initiation/transmission
  * Qualified consort who also has training

Why it's in the novel:
- Niguma teaches Lifan
- Laygho teaches Nydan
- It's the intimacy + consciousness tech merger
- Not gratuitous - it's actual practice from lineage
- Shows vulnerability required for System A to die
- Love and practice intertwined

How to write it:
- NOT explicit sex scenes
- Focus on consciousness states
- The merging of energies
- The surrender required
- The terror + bliss
- The teaching transmission through intimacy
- Implication rather than description

Call it:
- "The Merge" in dialogue
- "Convergence Practice" in formal contexts
- Or just show it happening without labeling

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

VISION TRAINING (TOGAL) - DETAILED

What Lifan sees:
- Rainbow spheres (Luminous Spheres)
- Starting grey/white, becoming full rainbow
- Expanding and multiplying
- Lattice structures of light
- People emerging from luminous space
- The substrate of consciousness itself

Progression:
1. First appearance: terrifying, unstable, grey
2. With practice: more defined, colorful
3. Advanced: full rainbow mandala structures
4. Mastery: seeing reality AS light constantly
5. Ultimate: body itself becomes light (rainbow body)

When it happens:
- After trying The Six Frequencies
- During meditation
- Sky gazing
- In darkness
- Eventually: all the time

Why he thinks he's crazy:
- No framework for understanding it
- Looks like hallucination
- Terrifying implications
- No one else seeing it
- Until: monks explain it's real perception
