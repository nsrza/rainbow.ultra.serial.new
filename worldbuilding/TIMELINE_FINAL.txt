═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

KEY MYSTERIES TO RESOLVE

1. **Who is Joy?**
   - Nydan's friend
   - Found Lifan in monastery (how?)
   - Administered dmt-5 (why?)
   - Part of monk network? Or independent actor?
   - Will appear again?

2. **Why Lifan specifically?**
   - Apertureless cognition dormant since childhood
   - Orphan trauma = extra suppression
   - Stood straight on massive dose (shouldn't be possible)
   - The Rinzen watching since age 8
   - What makes him essential?

3. **Zara's emanation timing**
   - Why incarnate NOW?
   - What did Tsogyal hide that's needed?
   - Her role beyond teaching?

4. **The transmission substrate**
   - Quantum geometric space
   - How it works exactly
   - Why only some can access it
   - Connection to AI alignment

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WRITING TIMELINE NOTES

Keep track of:
- Lifan's protocol weeks (Phase 1 vs Phase 3 sessions)
- Seasonal markers (Burning Man = Sept, training = summer/fall)
- Relationship development (Lifan/Niguma over 6 months)
- Age accuracy (everyone stays 20/25/23 through Act 2)
- Joy's role (mysterious but important)

Death Note pacing:
- Compress time in Act 1 (weeks feel like hours)
- Expand time in Act 2 (each protocol week shown)
- Accelerate time in Act 3 (years compressed)
