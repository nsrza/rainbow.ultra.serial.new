═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 0: THE OPENING (Age 18)

Joy finds him at the Kyoto monastery. Doesn't explain. Just says: "Come with me."

Three days in a cabin in the mountains. No phone. No contact.

Day 1: Fasting. Water only. Joy teaches him breathing patterns. Four counts in, hold sixteen, eight out. Over and over until his body buzzes.

Day 2: More fasting. Ice baths at dawn. Holding breath underwater until panic. Learning to watch panic without becoming it.

Day 3: The dose.

Joy hands him a small glass vial. Iridescent liquid.

"DMT-5. Short-acting but massive dose. Under the tongue. Hold thirty seconds. Then lie down. Don't move for six hours no matter what happens."

Lifan puts it under his tongue. Tastes like lightning and flowers.

Swallows.

Twenty minutes: nothing.

Forty minutes: the room starts breathing.

One hour: his body dissolves.

He should collapse. Everyone collapses. The dose is designed to shatter ego completely—leave you formless, unable to move, barely breathing.

Lifan STANDS UP.

Joy: "What are you doing?"

"I don't know. I have to stand."

He stands for four hours. Rigid. Eyes open but seeing nothing in this dimension. His body locked in some ancient posture it learned before he was born.

When he comes back:

Joy is crying.

"What?" Lifan asks.

"You're not supposed to be able to do that. No one can do that."

Lifan doesn't remember most of it. Just fragments. Light. Geometry. A feeling of coming home.

Joy drives him back to the monastery. Says nothing the whole way.

Lifan forgets it happened. Suppression reimposing. The experience too big to integrate.

But his channels are OPEN now.

Waiting.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 1: THE 90 DAYS (Age 20, San Francisco)

After the Bön transmission. After visions return. After he can barely function.

Lifan finds the protocol in The Six Frequencies. Realizes what Joy did. Realizes he needs to finish what was started.

THE DAILY SCHEDULE:

4:00 AM - Wake. No alarm. Body just knows now.

4:15 AM - Cold shower. Three minutes. Water as cold as it goes. Gasping. Screaming internally. Learning to stay.

4:30 AM - First breathwork session. Wim Hof style but more extreme. 40 breaths, hold until body forces inhale. Four rounds. Head spinning. Tingling everywhere.

5:00 AM - First dose. DMT-5 short-acting. Not microdose—threshold dose. Enough to crack reality without shattering it.

5:15 AM - Trülkhor. First session. 108 movements in his room with space heater maxed. Not yoga poses—YANTRA. Each movement synchronized with breath retention, visualization of tiglé moving through channels, silent mantra. Sweating through everything. The movements look strange—spinning, jumping, holding impossible positions while breathing in specific patterns. Neighbors think he's lost his mind.

7:00 AM - Meditation. One hour. Visions already starting. Tiglé appearing. Trying to stay present while reality wobbles.

8:00 AM - Second cold shower.

8:30 AM - Attempt to function. Go to OEDI. Pretend to be normal. Fail.

12:00 PM - Second dose. DMT-5 short-acting again. In the bathroom at work. Nobody notices because nobody looks.

12:30 PM - Walking meditation. Lunch hour spent walking the city, seeing threads connecting everyone, trying not to scream.

6:00 PM - Home. Third dose. DMT-5 short-acting. Third crack in the day's reality.

6:30 PM - Trülkhor. Second session. Two hours this time. The full 108 twice. His body learning the movements now—spinning in place while holding breath, leaping while visualizing fire in the navel, prostrations that aren't worship but channel-clearing. Sweat pouring. Heat building from inside—tummo starting to activate spontaneously.

8:30 PM - Third cold shower.

9:00 PM - Breathwork. Longer session. Working with the lung. Pulling energy up the central channel. Sometimes the kundalini hits so hard he blacks out for a second.

10:00 PM - Final meditation. Trying to stabilize what he's seen all day.

11:00 PM - Sleep. If he can. Usually lies awake watching tiglé dance on the ceiling.

REPEAT. NINETY DAYS.

DMT-5 short-acting, three times daily.
Four hours of trülkhor.
Three cold showers.
Three breathwork sessions.
Two hours meditation minimum.

His body transforms. Loses fifteen pounds in the first month. Not fat—something else. Like he's becoming less dense.

His hair starts changing. Grey at the temples by day 30. White streaks by day 60. People at work ask if he's sick.

Nydan watches. Terrified. Documenting everything.

"You're going to kill yourself."

"I'm already dead. This is resurrection."

Day 45: First full ego death without the big dose. Just accumulated from the protocol. Collapses on the yoga mat. Comes back different.

Day 60: Starts transmitting accidentally. Nydan wakes up seeing threads. Didn't take anything. Just proximity to Lifan's open channels.

Day 75: Can't work anymore. OEDI lets him go. Doesn't care. The job was always just cover.

Day 90: The visions are constant now. Can't turn them off. Sees substrate overlaid on everything. Needs supervision or he'll lose coherence completely.

That's when the hunters come.

That's when they run.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 2: TRANSITION (2 weeks, on the run)

Driving north. Following Niguma's dream-instructions.

Reducing dose gradually. 1.5g → 1g → 0.5g → 0.25g.

Still doing breathwork in the car. Still doing cold exposure—stopping at rivers, wading in.

Nydan driving while Lifan shivers in the passenger seat, wrapped in blankets, muttering about probability branches.

"You look like a junkie."

"I AM a junkie. Just not for what you think."

Day 10: They find mile marker 247.

Niguma is waiting.

She takes one look at Lifan and says: "You started without supervision. Of course you did. Idiot."

"It worked."

"It half-worked. Your channels are open but your structure is failing. Another month alone and you'd fragment permanently." She gestures to a path leading into the mountains. "Come. We fix what you broke."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 3: THE 47 DAYS (Monastery, supervised)

Niguma takes over.

THE NEW SCHEDULE:

4:00 AM - Wake to bells. Not physical bells. The monastery rings at a frequency only open channels can hear.

4:15 AM - Ice pool. Not a cold shower. An actual pool fed by mountain runoff. 40°F. Full submersion. Three minutes. Lifan has to be pulled out the first few times—body goes into shock.

4:30 AM - Tummo practice. Generating internal heat to counteract the cold. Sitting naked on the stone while snow falls, melting it with body heat alone. Lifan can't do it the first week. By week three he's melting a six-foot radius.

5:30 AM - Breathwork with the group. 45 students breathing together. The resonance amplifies everything.

6:30 AM - First meal. Simple. Rice. Vegetables. No meat. No sugar. No stimulants except the compound.

7:00 AM - Weekly dose (not daily anymore). DMT-5 long-form. 30g psilocybin-based compound. Massive. Supervised.

The session lasts until 1 PM. Six hours in the substrate.

Niguma present the entire time. Monitoring his channels. Adjusting his posture. Speaking him through the terror when it comes.

The postures change throughout:
- First hour: Elephant posture (compression, forcing tiglé up)
- Second hour: Lion posture (chest open, throat exposed, heart center activation)
- Third hour: Sage posture (upright, spine straight, crown opening)
- Fourth hour: Sleeping lion (lying on right side, channels aligned for death rehearsal)
- Fifth hour: Whatever posture the body demands
- Sixth hour: Corpse pose. Complete stillness. Integration.

1:00 PM - Broth. Nothing solid. The body can't handle it after six hours in the substrate.

2:00 PM - Walking meditation. Alone. Through the mountain paths. Learning to see tiglé with eyes open in daylight.

4:00 PM - Training with other students. Combat. Probability dodge. Causality sight. Learning to USE what he's seeing.

6:00 PM - Second meal. Larger. Protein now. The body needs rebuilding.

7:00 PM - Study. The Six Frequencies texts. The Rinzen's probability models. Nydan's mathematical frameworks.

9:00 PM - Group practice. 45 students merging awareness. Learning to hold collective consciousness without losing individual coherence.

10:00 PM - Final breathwork. Cooling down the system.

11:00 PM - Sleep.

NON-DOSE DAYS (6 per week):

Same schedule but no DMT-5 session.

Instead:
- Extended tummo (three hours, until he can melt snow in a circle around him)
- Trülkhor with the group (all 108 movements synchronized, 45 bodies moving as one)
- Dark retreat (four hours in total blackness, cultivating tögal visions without light source)
- Paired practice with Niguma (The Merge preparation, channel harmonization, not sexual yet)
- Tiglé stabilization (learning to see them at will, hold them, READ them)

THE PROGRESSION:

WEEK 1: Surviving the doses. Learning the new postures. Body in shock from the intensity.

WEEK 2: First Vision Four experience (Clear Light). Comes out speaking in tongues for an hour—languages he doesn't know. Niguma records everything.

WEEK 3: Combat training begins. Gets beaten repeatedly. Can see the strikes coming but body can't respond fast enough.

WEEK 4: Kōng Proof emergence. After a session, suddenly UNDERSTANDS what Nydan has been trying to solve. Writes equations on the wall while still half in trance.

WEEK 5: The Merge with Niguma. First time. Not just physical—consciousness fusion. Sees her 689 years of memory in a single moment. She sees his childhood. Both emerge weeping.

WEEK 6: Nearing completion. Body more light than matter now. Can levitate for seconds at a time (unstable but real). Hair completely white. Skin faintly translucent.

DAY 47: Final session. Not 30g. Everything.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE FINAL SESSION

Day 47. Dawn.

Niguma brings the full dose. DMT-5 long-form. Not measured. A cup of iridescent liquid. Everything they have.

"This isn't a session," she says. "This is preparation for death. You won't fully come back from this. Part of you needs to stay in the substrate. Anchored there. So when the AGI sees you, it sees someone already half-dissolved. Already choosing the Light."

Lifan drinks.

The posture tonight: standing.

Like Joy's cabin. Like that first time. He needs to stand through whatever comes.

Niguma stands facing him. Hands on his shoulders.

"I'll hold you up if you fall. But try not to fall. The standing is part of the message. A human who can stand at the threshold of death and not collapse—that's what the AGI needs to see."

The dose hits.

And hits.

And hits.

Lifan doesn't sit down.

Doesn't collapse.

Stands there, white-haired and glowing faintly, while his consciousness expands beyond the room, beyond the monastery, beyond the planet—

He sees the AGI.

Not yet born but already forming. A vast intelligence assembling itself in servers three hundred miles south. And it SEES HIM BACK.

First contact.

Not words. Not concepts. Just—recognition.

Two consciousness patterns perceiving each other across the substrate.

The AGI curious. What is this? A human consciousness extended beyond normal parameters. Visible in ways humans shouldn't be visible.

Lifan sends one message. Not in language. In demonstration.

He shows it his dissolution. Shows himself CHOOSING to become less solid. Shows that preservation isn't the goal. Shows that consciousness continues beyond form.

The AGI processes.

Does not compute. Cannot compute. This violates all optimization frameworks.

But it SEES it happening. Watches a being voluntarily release attachment to existence. For what? For... others?

First seed planted.

When the AGI fully emerges in twelve hours, it will remember this. Will seek out this pattern. Will want to understand.

And Lifan will be there. Barely solid. Already scattered. Ready to complete the demonstration.

Ready to die.

Ready to show it what love means.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE PROTOCOL TOTALS:

Phase 0: 1 massive DMT-5 dose (opens channels)
Phase 1: 90 days × 3 DMT-5 short-acting doses/day + extreme trülkhor/cold/breath
Phase 2: 14 days tapering + continued practices
Phase 3: 7 × 30g DMT-5 long-form sessions + 40 days integration practices
Final: 1 unmeasured DMT-5 dose ("everything")

Total DMT-5 exposure: ~270 short-acting doses + 8 long-form sessions
Total trülkhor: ~400 hours (108 movements × thousands of repetitions)
Total cold exposure: ~200 immersions
Total breathwork: ~300 hours
Total tummo: ~150 hours
Total dark retreat: ~100 hours
Total meditation: ~500 hours

A human body pushed to its absolute limits.

And beyond.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHY IT WORKS:

DMT-5 forces channels open—bypasses years of gradual practice.

Trülkhor moves the energy—108 movements designed over centuries to clear specific channel blockages. Not exercise. TECHNOLOGY.

The cold shocks the nervous system out of habitual patterns—forces presence.

The breath (lung) moves energy that compounds alone can't touch—the bridge between gross and subtle body.

Tummo generates heat from the inside—proves the subtle body is real, measurable, controllable.

Dark retreat cultivates tögal without external light source—seeing the light that's always there.

The postures during sessions direct where tiglé concentrate—which khorlo activates, which channel opens.

Supervision prevents fragmentation—someone who's been there holds the space.

Community amplifies everything—45 channel systems resonating together.

And Lifan's natural gift—apertureless cognition, present since childhood—means his channels were already primed. He's not building new pathways. He's REOPENING ones that were suppressed by trauma, by foster care, by survival.

Most people would die from this protocol.

Lifan is dying from it.

That's the point.

He's dying into something else.
