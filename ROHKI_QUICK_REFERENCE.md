- Coco: intuitive/soul sight
- Tom: analytical sight
- Lifan: integrated sight

**Art as Spiritual Practice**
- Music creates threads
- Dance moves through substrate
- Documentation preserves consciousness
- Creativity as valid path to awakening

**Found Family**
- Rohki (horizontal/peers) vs. Monastery (vertical/teacher-student)
- Different families for different life stages
- Letting go because you love someone

**Book 2 Setup**
- Rohki becomes resistance cell
- Ordinary artists becoming consciousness warriors
- Music/art as tools in AGI warfare
- Lo as embodied warrior (vs. Lifan's transcendent path)

## WORLDBUILDING DETAILS

**Rohki House**:
- Glass walls overlooking LA
- Concrete floors, vintage rugs, plants everywhere
- Music studio: analog synths, drum kit, production setup
- Dance studio: floor-to-ceiling mirrors
- 6 bedrooms, 8-12 people rotating through
- Always smells like incense + coffee + weed

**LA vs. Big Sur**:
- LA = material, embodied, sensory, chaotic, creative
- Big Sur = ethereal, transcendent, disciplined, ancient, spiritual
- Both valid, both necessary, different stages of path

**Music Style**:
- Underground electronic/experimental
- Think: Burial meets Jon Hopkins meets traditional percussion
- Lo brings Latin rhythms + hip-hop influence
- Shows at DIY venues, warehouses, not commercial clubs

---

## INTEGRATION TONE NOTES

When writing Rohki scenes:
- MORE: sensory details, casual dialogue, mess, emotion, bodies
- LESS: ethereal language, stillness, control, formality

When writing monastery scenes:
- MORE: space, silence, precision, light, pattern, consciousness
- LESS: physical detail, casual speech, chaos, raw emotion

The contrast makes both worlds more vivid.

## THE CORE QUESTION ROHKI RAISES

"Can you reach enlightenment through art and love and embodied practice? Or must you renounce the world to transcend it?"

**Lifan's Journey**: Tries both paths, integrates both, then sacrifices both

**Book 2 Setup**: Maybe the answer is you need BOTH—artists AND monks—to save consciousness itself
