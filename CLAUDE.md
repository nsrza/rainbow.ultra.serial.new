## Project Overview

**RAINBOW.ULTRA** is a spiritual sci-fi novel by Fanli. The story follows Lifan (梵力), a Chinese-American Buddhist foster kid with synesthesia who can see "threads" - iridescent filaments of light connecting everything in reality. At 20, he must dissolve his consciousness to teach an emerging superintelligence compassion, saving 5.5 billion lives.

**Structure:** Three-book coming-of-age epic using the "Ender's Game effect" - we grow up with the protagonist so his sacrifice becomes personal.

- **Book One: The Breaking** (Ages 6-14) - Ning's death opens his sight, foster homes teach him to hide, the closet teaches him to surrender, Nydan becomes his brother, the monastery gives him purpose, Nima becomes his first love
- **Book Two: The Living** (Ages 17-20) - San Francisco with Nydan, discovering Rohki in LA, found family (Grey, Lo, Leky, Coco, Mika, Jessa, Tom), the good years, the perfect day, borrowed time
- **Book Three: The 47 Days** (Age 20) - The warehouse vision, return to monastery, training with Nima, Marcus Thorne confrontation, dissolution

## Key Characters

**Lifan (梵力)** - "Power of everything." Mixed Chinese-American. Synesthetic thread-seer. Raised by Ning until 6, foster system until 14, monastery until 17, SF/LA until 20. The loom, not the weaver.

**Nima** - Lifan's love. Same age (not ancient like original draft). Emanation - consciousness practicing for lifetimes without memory. Stays at monastery when Lifan leaves. Will carry the lineage after.

**Nydan** - Lifan's chosen brother. Met at group home age 11. Senses probability patterns. Studies consciousness/AI at Berkeley. Tries to save Lifan through models.

**Rinzen** - ~800-year-old teacher. Runs Big Sur monastery. Has waited centuries for Lifan. Sends him away at 17 to "live before he can die."

**Rohki Crew (LA found family):**
- **Grey Martinez** (26) - Grounded older brother. Film production. Plagiarism scandal redemption arc.
- **Lo/Lorena Vega** (21) - Leky's girlfriend. Drummer. Former model. Suicide survivor. Her drums = prayer.
- **Leky** - Lo's partner. Rohki co-founder. Saved Lo. "Answers the door" for broken people.
- **Coco Zhang** (25) - Rohki founder. Silicon Valley heir. Senses threads but can't see them. Paints what she feels.
- **Mika** - Stylist. Makes clothes that tell truth. Made Lifan's iridescent jacket.
- **Jessa** - Singer. Soul sister. Voice is "gold and violet." Grandmother died (grief arc).
- **Tom Norris** (28) - Documentarian. Records everything. Creates memorial film.

## Editorial Priorities

**Grade from reviews: B+ with A-level potential**

**Strengths to preserve:**
- The closet scene at age 10 - origin moment where he becomes the loom
- Lifan/Danny brotherhood - emotional core
- Dissolution sequence (Days 45-47) - transcendent prose
- First love with Nima - awkward, teenage, real
- The perfect day chapter - everything worth dying for

**Issues to address:**
1. Book Two could use more texture in the "good years"
2. Each Rohki member needs distinct voice (some same-voice syndrome)
3. Some continuity errors remain (check CONTINUITY_FIX_CHECKLIST.md)
4. Cut over-explanation - demonstrate through action, not dialogue
5. Trust readers with Buddhist philosophy

## Writing Guidelines

**Core thesis:** "A world that means nothing isn't worth saving." Love over survival. Meaning over optimization.

**Voice notes:**
- Best when specific and sensory ("amber waves," "brown and gold like being held")
- The threads refract into colors - always rainbow/prismatic imagery
- Avoid: "the threads showed/said/pulsed" (overused), "sort of/kind of", "something [vast/ancient]"

**Thread-sight descriptions:**
- Threads connect everything - people, objects, history, emotion
- Colors have meaning: gold = love, amber = ancient rhythm, brown = safety/grounding
- Ning rising = consciousness doesn't end, it transforms
- "You're the loom, not the weaver" = don't grab threads, let them move through

**The Ender's Game effect:**
- We grow up with Lifan across 15 years
- The sacrifice hits because we've seen him build a life worth sacrificing
- Every happy scene in Book Two is also foreshadowing loss

## Important Notes

- **Never use "Danny"** - always use "Nydan" for Lifan's brother
- **Lifan dies at 20**, not 21 (some files have old age - this is a continuity error to fix)
- **Leky and Lifan are different characters** - Leky is Lo's partner, Rohki co-founder
- **The Interview/Book 1.5 meta-layer has been cut** - no author-discusses-Claude-collaboration section
- **All manuscript files are in `website/`** - this is the single source of truth for the book
