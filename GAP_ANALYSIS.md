# GAP ANALYSIS: Source Serial vs Riffed Versions

## VERDICT: Source serial is the foundation. Riffed versions are fan fiction.

---

## PROLOGUE COMPARISON

| Element | SOURCE (serial/) | RIFFED (website/) |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Year | 2038 | 2040 |
| Lifan's age | 20 | 21 |
| Location | Warehouse party, Valencia | Warehouse party, Mission |
| Nydan intro | Full character (phone call, escape plan) | Barely mentioned |
| Visual system | Colors: indigo bass, gold/silver synths, white fractals | Generic "wrong light" |
| Ning's death | Hospital, holding hand, age 6 | Garden aneurysm, age 6 |
| Probabilities | 94% AGI, 87% extinction, 47% if coordinates | None |
| World details | OEDI, Axiom AI, Tres House, Epaga | None |
| Thread description | Crystal, rainbow, translucent filaments | Generic "gossamer filaments" |

## STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCE

**SOURCE:** Linear thriller
- Prologue → Chapter 1 (escape) → Chapter 2 (monastery arrival) → 47-day countdown

**RIFFED:** YA flashback structure
- Prologue → "Part One: The Past" → Ages 6-14 backstory → Present

The riffed version restructured the story into a coming-of-age memoir. The source is a countdown thriller.

## CHARACTER COMPARISON

### NYDAN

**SOURCE (correct):**
- 26 years old
- Green eyes, freckles, dark skin, long hair
- MIT physicist
- IFS therapy reframed as computational agents
- Works at Tres House (AI researchers)
- Developed mechanistic alignment theory Axiom rejected
- Brother to Lifan for ~3 years (met at Burning Man)
- Probability models, contingency planning
- "Neurogenesis in a cup" tea

**RIFFED:**
- Barely appears in prologue
- No physical description
- No backstory
- No personality

### NING

**SOURCE:**
- Hospital death, Lifan holding her hand
- Light scattering into patterns
- "The smile he'd learned to refract"
- First saw threads at her death

**RIFFED:**
- Garden death (aneurysm)
- More screentime (full chapter)
- "看，梵力。Look" scene
- Rose and dahlia imagery
- Good prose but different story

## WORLDBUILDING GAPS

### SIX FREQUENCIES
**Source:** Colors appear naturally (indigo, gold, silver, white)
**Riffed:** "Wrong light" - no color system

### THREE THEORIES
**Source:** Not yet introduced (comes later)
**Riffed:** Not present

### COMBAT SYSTEM
**Source:** Not yet (comes later)
**Riffed:** Not present

### TECHNOLOGY
**Source:** OEDI workplace, Axiom AI, probability models, security cameras
**Riffed:** None

---

## WHAT RIFFED GOT RIGHT

1. **Closet scene** - Good prose, traumatic detail
2. **Foster home progression** - Hendersons, Marlowes, Rawlings sequence
3. **Ning's teachings** - "You're the loom, not the weaver"
4. **The smile** - "The smile he'd learned to refract"

---

## WHAT RIFFED GOT WRONG

1. **Structure** - Flashback memoir instead of thriller
2. **Timeline** - 2040 instead of 2038
3. **Nydan** - Missing entirely as character
4. **World** - No OEDI, no Axiom, no probability math
5. **Frequencies** - Generic threads instead of color system
6. **Pace** - Slows down for childhood instead of racing north

---

## INTEGRATION DECISION

### PRIMARY: Use source serial as foundation
The 16 episodes in `serial/` are the canonical story.

### SECONDARY: Salvage from riffed
- Some childhood prose (closet, foster homes) for bonus content
- "You're the loom" teaching for consistency check

### TERTIARY: Enhance with worldbuilding
Ensure all chapters properly reference:
- Six Frequencies (COMBAT_SYSTEM.md)
- Three Theories (THREE_THEORIES_INTEGRATION.md)
- Character details (CHARACTERS.txt, LIFAN_BIO.md)

---

## ACTION PLAN

1. **serial/** = canonical Book One
2. **website/** versions = deprecated (keep for reference)
3. **REWRITE/** = deprecated (Literary/YA experiments)
4. Create `integrated/` folder with enhanced source chapters
5. Inject worldbuilding where missing
6. Cross-reference all proper nouns against TERMS_DICTIONARY.txt
