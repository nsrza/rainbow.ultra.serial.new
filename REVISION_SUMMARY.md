## WHAT WAS DONE

### 1. Continuity Fixes Applied (26 line changes)

The following critical errors were fixed in `rainbow_ultra_REVISED.txt`:

#### DAY 40 QUADRUPLE ENTRY (FIXED)
- Chapter 8 "DAY 40" → Changed to **DAY 38** (Marcus arrives)
- Chapter 9 "DAY 40 (EVENING)" → Changed to **DAY 38 (EVENING)**
- Lineage transmission "DAY 40 — EVENING" → Changed to **DAY 39 — EVENING**

#### CHAPTER 6.5 OUT-OF-ORDER DAYS (FIXED)
- "DAY 37 — EVENING" → Changed to **DAY 39 — EVENING (CONTINUED)**
- "DAY 38 — DAWN" → Changed to **DAY 39 — CONTINUED**

#### NIGUMA AGE INCONSISTENCY (FIXED)
All references to Niguma being "eight hundred years old" changed to "nearly seven centuries" or "almost seven hundred years" (21 instances).

Kept Rinzen's "eight hundred years" references intact (his lineage IS 800+ years old).

#### NING TIMELINE FIX (FIXED)
The impossible "800 years since Ning first showed me" line was rewritten to clarify Ning showed him the vision more recently, while the lineage itself is 800 years old.

## ROHKI = THE BEL AIR GROUP

Rohki is Lifan's creative collective based in **Bel Air, Los Angeles**.

### Characters:
- **Grey Martinez** (23) - Grounded brother, film production
- **Lo/Lorena Vega** (21) - Leky's girlfriend, drummer/dancer
- **Coco Zhang** (25) - Founder of Rohki, trust fund patron
- **Tom Norris** (28) - Documentarian, writer

When the novel references "the LA group," "the Bel Air house," or "Rohki" - they all mean these people.

## THE HEART OF THE REVISION

**Before:** Lifan sacrifices himself for 5.5 billion strangers.

**After:** Lifan sacrifices himself for 5.5 billion strangers—and we watch him leave behind Grey, Lo, Coco, Tom, the Bel Air house, the music, the art, the community that loved him.

The sacrifice becomes personal because we feel what he's losing.
