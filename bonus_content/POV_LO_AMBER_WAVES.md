# LO: AMBER WAVES

*Bel Air, Los Angeles*
*March 2038*

---

Lo had been playing drums since she was four.

Twenty-one years. Conservatory. Vogue cover shoots where they made her pose with sticks like they were accessories. Session work for producers who wanted "ethnic percussion" without actually listening to what she played.

Twenty-one years, and nobody had ever told her what her music looked like.

Then this skinny kid showed up and said "amber waves" and she lost her entire shit.

◇ ◇ ◇

"Play it again," she said, for the third time that night.

Lifan was sitting in the corner, looking like he wanted to disappear into the wall. Poor kid. He didn't know what he'd done.

"I didn't mean to—"

"Play it again means *play it again*." She picked up her sticks. "I'll drum. You tell me what you see. And don't you dare edit yourself this time."

He nodded. Terrified.

She started playing.

Not the ancestral rhythm this time. Something newer. Something she'd been working on for months, trying to capture the feeling of walking away from fashion week, from the money and the lights and the people who only saw her body and never her hands.

"Gunmetal," Lifan said softly. "Sharp. Like broken glass catching streetlights."

She changed the rhythm. Lighter. Playful.

"Gold sparks. Confetti. But there's something underneath—" He tilted his head. "—something heavy holding it all together. An anchor."

She switched again. The old rhythm. Her grandmother's rhythm, the one she'd learned before she could talk.

"Amber waves," he said again. "But this time—" His voice caught. "This time I can see where it comes from. I can see *her*. Whoever she was. She's in every hit."

Lo stopped playing.

The room was silent. Somewhere in the house, someone was laughing. Jessa was singing in the kitchen. Normal Rohki night, except nothing was normal anymore.

"You can see my grandmother," Lo said. Not a question.

"I—" He looked like he might throw up. "I see connections. Threads. Between people. Between—" He gestured vaguely. "Everything. And when you play, it's like the threads become visible. Like you're pulling them out of hiding."

"And my grandmother?"

"She's in the rhythm. Not—not literally. But the pattern she taught you, the way she moved her hands, the love she put into showing you—it's still there. You carry her."

Lo put down her sticks.

She was not a person who cried. She'd walked away from a million dollars without flinching. She'd told the head of her agency to go fuck himself when he suggested she lose ten pounds. She'd built Rohki from nothing with Coco and Leky, through exhaustion and doubt and everyone saying it wouldn't work.

She was *not* a person who cried.

But right now, in this studio, with this weird kid telling her things nobody had ever seen—

"Shit," she said, wiping her face. "LEKY! Get in here!"

◇ ◇ ◇

After that night, Lo claimed Lifan.

Not in a weird way. Not romantically—she had Leky, and besides, the kid was clearly in love with someone far away. But in the way she claimed all her people: absolutely, permanently, non-negotiably.

"You're mine now," she told him the next morning. "That's not up for debate."

"I—okay?"

"Good. Now come help me with this beat. I've been stuck on it for weeks. Tell me what you see."

They worked together for six hours. By the end, Lo had cracked the rhythm she'd been chasing for months. And Lifan had learned that sometimes "amber waves" wasn't a description—it was a collaboration.

"You should make your own music," Lo said, as he was leaving.

"I can't play anything."

"Doesn't matter. You hear what nobody else hears. That's rarer than talent." She pointed at his chest. "Whatever's in there? It wants to come out. Stop fighting it."

He looked at her like she'd spoken a foreign language.

*God*, she thought. *How broken did the world have to be, to make this kid think he has nothing to offer?*

She was going to fix that. If it took years. If it took everything.

She was going to show him what she saw when he described her music: someone worth more than he knew. Someone who deserved to take up space. Someone who could see the whole damn universe and still doubted he had permission to exist.

"Come back tomorrow," she said. "Bring whatever you've got. Even if it's just noise."

He nodded. She watched him walk out, already planning the next session.

*Amber waves*, she thought. *That's what he saw in me.*

Time to show him what she saw in him.
