# NIMA: FIRST SIGHT

*Big Sur Monastery*
*June 2034*

She knew him before she saw him.

Being an emanation meant sometimes you remembered things that hadn't happened yet. Rinzen called it "temporal bleed." Nima called it "the worst superpower ever invented."

For three nights she'd been dreaming about a boy. Dark eyes. Skin like earth. Threads pouring through him like he was made of glass.

And every dream ended the same way: him dissolving. Her screaming. A light so bright it burned everything it touched.

*Great*, she thought, waking soaked in sweat for the third time. *Another apocalypse boyfriend.*

She was fourteen. She'd been at the monastery since she was seven. She'd seen things that would break most adults and learned meditation techniques that sounded fake even when they worked.

But she'd never seen anyone like the boy who walked up the coastal path that afternoon.

◇ ◇ ◇

He looked like hell.

That was her first thought. Skinny—too skinny, like he'd been forgetting to eat. Clothes that didn't fit right. Eyes that kept moving, tracking something she couldn't see.

*The threads*, she realized. *He's already seeing them.*

Rinzen stood at the monastery gate, waiting. He'd been waiting for three days—ever since he'd announced that "the loom" was coming and everyone should "prepare accordingly."

Nobody knew what that meant. Nima suspected nobody ever would.

"You made it," Rinzen said.

The boy—Lifan, she knew without being told—looked at the old man with an expression she recognized: the desperate hope of someone who'd been drowning and finally saw shore.

"You're real," Lifan said. "I wasn't sure if—I thought maybe I was just crazy, and the pull was just—"

"You're not crazy." Rinzen smiled. "You're something much more inconvenient. Come inside. You need food. Then we'll talk."

He led Lifan through the gate. And as they passed, Lifan looked at Nima.

Just for a second. Just long enough for their eyes to meet.

*Oh*, she thought. *Oh no.*

Because she saw it then—clear as the dreams, clear as anything she'd ever seen. The two of them, older, holding each other. The two of them, fighting. The two of them, saying goodbye while light poured out of his skin.

*He's going to die*, she thought. *I'm going to love him and he's going to die.*

She was fourteen. She'd been trained to accept impossible things.

But this—watching him walk past, knowing everything and nothing, feeling her whole future collapse into a single point of light—

This was the hardest thing she'd ever done: not running away.

◇ ◇ ◇

She avoided him for a week.

It wasn't hard. The monastery was big, the schedule was rigid, and new students were kept separate until they "stabilized." Whatever that meant.

But she watched him.

From the meditation hall, through the gaps between bodies during morning practice. From the kitchen, pretending to wash dishes while he ate alone at the back table. From the cliffs, where she screamed her rage into the ocean, and sometimes she'd see him walking the path below, looking just as lost as she felt.

*Don't*, she told herself. *Don't get attached. You know how this ends.*

But the dreams wouldn't stop. And each night they got clearer.

His hands on her face. Her voice saying *I'll be here*. The taste of his mouth, which she somehow knew even though they'd never touched.

*This is so unfair*, she thought, night after night, punching her pillow until her knuckles bruised. *This is so incredibly unfair.*

She was supposed to be the calm one. The prodigy. The emanation who remembered past lives and accepted her fate with grace.

She didn't feel graceful. She felt like screaming.

◇ ◇ ◇

He found her on the cliffs.

Day eight. Sunset. She was sitting on the edge, feet dangling over nothing, watching the waves smash against rocks a hundred feet below.

"That seems dangerous," he said behind her.

"It is." She didn't turn around. "What do you want?"

"I—" He hesitated. "Rinzen said I should talk to you. Something about parallel training."

"Rinzen says a lot of things." She finally looked at him. He was standing three feet back, like he was afraid the cliff might reach up and grab him. "You don't have to be scared. The rocks are pretty far down."

"I'm not scared of the rocks." He was looking at her the way she'd been looking at him all week. Like he recognized her. Like he'd seen her before.

*Because he has*, she realized. *He dreams too.*

"You know," she said.

It wasn't a question.

He nodded slowly. "I've been dreaming about you. Since before I got here."

"Same."

Silence. The waves crashed below them. The fog rolled in from the ocean, turning everything soft.

"In my dreams," he said carefully, "you're—we're—"

"I know."

"And at the end—"

"I *know*."

She stood. Turned to face him fully. He looked terrified and hopeful and completely lost, and she felt something crack open in her chest.

*Don't*, said the smart part of her brain. *Walk away. Protect yourself.*

But the rest of her—the part that remembered lifetimes, the part that had been waiting for him since before she was born—

That part stepped forward.

"I'm Nima," she said. "And we should probably talk."
