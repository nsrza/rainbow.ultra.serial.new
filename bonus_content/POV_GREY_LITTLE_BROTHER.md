# GREY: LITTLE BROTHER

*Los Angeles, Silver Lake*
*February 2038*

The kid was weird.

That was Grey's first thought when Nydan's friend climbed out of that ancient Honda Civic. Not bad weird. Not dangerous weird. Just—*weird*. The kind of weird that made you look twice and then three times and then realize you'd been staring.

He was maybe seventeen. Mixed—something and something, hard to pin down. Had that look people got when they'd spent their whole lives being asked "what are you?" Moved like a dancer or a fighter, all controlled grace and hidden tension.

And his eyes never stopped moving.

"So you're the one Nydan won't shut up about," Grey said, shaking his hand. "The kid who sees things."

The kid—Lifan—went still. "He told you?"

"He told me he studies consciousness. I asked questions. He answered vaguely." Grey shrugged. "I've been in LA long enough to know that 'vaguely' usually means 'there's some wild shit happening and I can't explain it.'"

Lifan relaxed. Just a little. "I don't know if I can do what Nydan says I can do. I don't know if I can do anything."

*Bullshit*, Grey thought. He'd been in the industry for five years. He knew a star when he saw one—that quality that made cameras love you and people lean in. Lifan had it turned up to eleven and didn't seem to know.

"Yeah, okay," Grey said. "Let's go meet Coco. You'll fit right in with the other weirdos."

◇ ◇ ◇

The first night at Rohki, Grey watched.

That was his job—had been since he was seven years old and realized he was the only one in his foster home paying attention. Watch. Notice. Protect.

And what he noticed about Lifan was this:

The kid was *starving*.

Not for food. For something else. For belonging, maybe. For people who didn't look at him like he was broken. Every time someone laughed at his joke or touched his arm or included him in the conversation, his whole face changed. Like someone had turned on a light inside him.

*Christ*, Grey thought. *How lonely has this kid been?*

He knew the answer. He'd been the same way once—fresh out of the system, convinced he didn't deserve to exist, waiting for everyone to figure out he was a fraud and leave.

It had taken Coco three years to convince him otherwise. To show him that "found family" wasn't just a phrase.

Looking at Lifan, he figured it might take less time. The kid was already halfway there.

◇ ◇ ◇

The first time Lifan described Lo's drumming, Grey almost fell off his chair.

They were in the studio. Lo was doing her thing—that deep, ancient, patient rhythm that made Grey's bones hum. Normal night. Normal jam session.

Then Lifan opened his mouth.

"Amber waves," he said, quiet, like he was talking to himself. "Ancient. Like something that's been waiting to be heard for centuries. Your grandmother's grandmother's grandmother knew this rhythm. It's in your bones."

Lo stopped playing.

Grey had known Lo for four years. He'd seen her take down a record exec with a single look. He'd watched her walk away from a million-dollar contract because it didn't feel right. Nothing fazed her.

But the look on her face right now—

"What did you say?" she whispered.

And Lifan, clueless, terrified, clearly thinking he'd said something wrong: "I—I'm sorry, I didn't mean to—"

"Say it again." Lo leaned forward. "What do you see when I play?"

Grey watched Lifan struggle. Watched him decide to trust. Watched him describe something Grey couldn't see but could somehow *feel*—the gold and ochre trails, the sunlight through earth, the weight of centuries in every beat.

When he finished, Lo was crying.

*Okay*, Grey thought. *This kid's the real deal.*

And something shifted in his chest. Something that had been waiting since he was seven years old for someone worth protecting.

*Little brother*, his brain supplied. *That's what he is. That's what he's going to be.*

Grey didn't fight it. He'd learned a long time ago that some things were meant to happen.

◇ ◇ ◇

Six months later, he sat on the roof with Lifan after the birthday party.

Everyone else had gone to bed or passed out. The city sparkled below them. Somewhere in the house, Jessa was still singing, soft and low, a lullaby for whoever was listening.

"Thank you," Lifan said. His voice was hoarse from crying. "For tonight. For—all of this."

"Don't thank me. Thank Coco. She's the one who found you."

"But you're the one who—" Lifan stopped. Tried again. "You treat me like family. Like I actually belong here. And I keep waiting for you to figure out I'm—"

"A fraud? A fake? Someone who doesn't deserve any of this?"

Lifan flinched. "How did you—"

"Because I felt the same way. For years. Coco had to beat it out of me." Grey looked at him. "That voice in your head? The one that says you're not good enough? It's lying. It's been lying your whole life."

"You don't know—"

"I know you see things nobody else sees. I know you describe people's art in ways that make them feel *seen* for the first time. I know everyone in that room tonight would take a bullet for you, and we've only known you a year."

Grey put his hand on Lifan's shoulder. Heavy. Grounding.

"You're family now. That's not up for debate. That's not something you can lose. Even if you tried to run—and I can see you thinking about it—we'd find you. We'd drag you back. Because that's what family does."

Lifan was crying again. Quietly. Like he was trying to hide it.

"I don't know how to—" His voice cracked. "I've never had—"

"I know." Grey squeezed his shoulder. "You'll learn. We'll teach you."

They sat there until sunrise. Didn't talk about anything important. Just—sat. Together.

And Grey thought: *Whatever's coming, whatever this kid is meant for—*

*I'm going to be there when it happens.*

He didn't know what that meant. Not yet.

But he would.
