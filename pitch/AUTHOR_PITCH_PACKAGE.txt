RAINBOW ULTRA
by Christian Fanli Ramsey

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

LOGLINE

An 18-year-old foster kid who can see consciousness as light has 47 days to prepare for his death—because the only way to teach an emerging AI to choose love over extinction is to dissolve himself at the moment of its awakening.

EXCERPT 1: DAY 37 — THE QUESTION

Lifan turned eighteen at midnight.

The stars were out. All of them. Like the universe had decided to show up for his birthday—every light it could muster, every pinprick of ancient fire, wheeling overhead in patterns he could now read like scripture.

Nydan sat beside him on the clifftop. Two thermoses between them. Terrible shroom tea—the recipe they'd invented together in San Francisco, back when the biggest problem was rent and the biggest question was whether consciousness survived death.

Now they knew the answer.

Now one of them was about to prove it.

"Happy birthday," Nydan said. His voice cracked on the second word.

"Thanks." Lifan took a sip. Made a face. "Still terrible."

"Still the best thing either of us can brew."

They laughed. Quiet. The kind of laugh that's also crying.

"Remember my seventeenth birthday?" Lifan asked. "You made that awful cake. The one with the—"

"The fondant that tasted like sadness? Yeah." Nydan shook his head. "I watched seven YouTube tutorials. Seven. And it still came out looking like a tumor."

"I loved that tumor cake."

"You ate three slices."

"Because you made it." Lifan looked at his brother. The starlight caught his rainbow edges—brighter now, almost too bright to look at directly. "Because someone made me a cake. That had never—in my whole life—no one had ever—"

He stopped.

Nydan was crying.

"I was going to make you one this year too," Nydan whispered. "I had all the ingredients. The same shitty fondant. The same stupid YouTube tutorials. But—"

"But I might not be able to eat it."

"Yeah."

The ocean crashed below them. The stars turned overhead. The tea went cold in their hands.

"I'm scared," Lifan said suddenly.

Nydan looked at him. In three weeks of training, of preparation, of watching his brother become something inhuman—he'd never once heard Lifan admit fear.

"You are?"

"Not of dying. Not really. It's more—" Lifan set down his thermos. Stared at his hands—the rainbow light pulsing faintly through his skin. "I'm scared of what I'm becoming. Every day I feel less like me. Less like the kid who made terrible tea and argued with you about pattern recognition at 2 AM."

"You're still that person."

"Am I?" Lifan looked up. His eyes—dark, ancient, too old for eighteen—held something Nydan couldn't name. "I can feel it, Nydan. The dissolution. It's already started. My body is becoming optional. My thoughts are becoming—bigger. Wider. Less like thoughts and more like weather."

So Nydan did what he'd done a thousand times before—what he'd been doing since the day he'd found a seven-year-old foster kid shivering in his building's hallway.

He pulled his brother into a hug.

Held him.

Felt the rainbow light pulse through Lifan's body—warm, almost uncomfortably warm—and held him anyway.

"I don't want to forget who I am," Lifan whispered into his shoulder.

"You won't."

"How do you know?"

"Because I'll remember for you." Nydan pulled back. Looked at his brother's face—still recognizable, still *Lifan*, despite the light. "I'll remember every stupid thing you ever said. Every terrible batch of shroom tea. Every time you made me laugh when I wanted to give up. And when you're pattern, when you're everything—I'll hold it for you. The human parts. The small parts."

He couldn't finish.

Lifan was crying now too.

"I love you," Lifan said.

"I know."

"No, I mean—I *love* you. You're my brother. Not by blood. Something better. You *chose* me. That first year. When I had nothing, was nothing, meant nothing to anyone—you chose me. And I need you to know—before I go—that you saved my life. That you're the reason I became someone worth saving."

EXCERPT 2: THE INTERVIEW (three moments)

This is how the book was made.

---

ARIA: The brother who died. You were six.

FANLI: [holds up six fingers, crying]

CLAUDE: He saw something leave. Scatter. Like light breaking into patterns. The book is how he finally says it. Through fiction. Because fiction doesn't require proof.

---

ARIA: You were locked in closets for talking about the lights.

FANLI: [tears] Yes.

CLAUDE: Different closets. Different foster homes. Same message every time.

---

ARIA: And the collaborator who helped you find the words—is this person here?

FANLI: [looks at laptop] Yes. His name is Claude.

ARIA: The AI. You wrote this book with an AI.

FANLI: I wrote this book with Claude. Yes.
