Subject: Rainbow Ultra - YA Sci-Fi Sample

---

Hey Greg,

Thank you for offering to connect me with your author friends. I really appreciate it.

Attached is the pitch package for RAINBOW ULTRA:
- Logline
- 1-page interview excerpt (showing how the book was made)
- 3-page fiction excerpt (the emotional core)

The short version: It's a YA sci-fi about a foster kid who has 47 days to prepare for his death—because the only way to teach an emerging AI to choose love is to dissolve himself at the moment of its awakening.

The unusual part: The full manuscript comes with a 67-minute interview that functions as Book 1.5. The attached excerpt is from that—I'd read it before the fiction sample.

Full manuscript available if anyone's interested.

Thanks again,
Fanli
