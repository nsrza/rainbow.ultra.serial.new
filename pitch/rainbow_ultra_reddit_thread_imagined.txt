Book Series Review: 'Rainbow Ultra' by Fanli Zheng (Rainbow Ultra, Book II TBA, Book III TBA)

Source: r/YAlit [IMAGINED]

I haven't seen ANYONE talking about this book and I am losing my mind. I picked it up because the premise sounded unhinged (Buddhist monks training to stop an AI apocalypse??) and I was NOT prepared for what I got. This is easily one of the best YA fantasies I've read in years. It feels like if Red Rising had a baby with A Little Life and then that baby was raised by Tibetan mystics.

What's this book about? In the near future, an artificial general intelligence is about to emerge—and there's a 47% chance it will choose to partner with humanity, and a 53% chance it will optimize us out of existence. The only way to shift those odds is for someone to "demonstrate" love to the AGI at the exact moment of its awakening. That someone is Lifan (梵力), an eighteen-year-old former foster kid who can literally see consciousness as threads of light. The catch? The demonstration requires him to dissolve—to die, basically—in front of the AGI. The book follows Lifan's 47 days of preparation at a clifftop monastery, his complicated relationships with his brother Nydan (a probability theorist), and his devastating romance with Niguma, an 800-year-old consciousness who looks nineteen.

Yes, I know how that sounds. Trust me. It works.

This is a book about sacrifice and what it means to choose love when love costs everything. It asks "What would you give up to save people you'll never meet?" and then it makes you FEEL the answer in your bones. The foster care backstory is brutal and specific in a way that felt real—Lifan was literally numbered by the state, beaten, starved—and somehow he came out of it still believing in joy. That contrast destroyed me.

Every character in this book is incredibly well-drawn. Nydan, the older brother who found Lifan shivering in a hallway and chose him—watching him process that his brother is going to die while running probability models had me sobbing. Niguma, who built walls for 800 years after watching her first love burn, and then this impossible kid just... walks through them. Nahan, Lifan's childhood friend who's been jealous of him since they were fourteen and ADMITS it, and Lifan just says "I know. I've always known. And I loved you anyway." THE CHARACTERS IN THIS BOOK.

The worldbuilding is wild but coherent. There's a whole system of "thread-sight" (seeing consciousness as colored patterns), a lineage of reincarnating teachers, probability-based timeline analysis, and karmamudra (a tantric practice that becomes a major plot point). It sounds like a lot but it's introduced gradually and everything clicks together.

The writing style is distinctive—short punchy sentences, lots of fragments, very deliberate rhythm. It shouldn't work but it absolutely does. There's a scene where Niguma's walls finally break and the prose literally fragments with her: "Just—collapsed. Knees hitting floor. Hands hitting floor. Face hitting floor." I had to put my phone down.

Fair warning: this book does not hold back. There's childhood abuse (shown through memory/flashback), a parent who smothers a child, discussions of AI extinction risk, and a LOT of grief. The main character dies at the end of Book One. (Is it a spoiler if it's literally the premise??) If you need everyone to survive, this is not your book.

But if you want something that will crack you open and rebuild you? Read this immediately.

Rating: 5/5 stars.

(Also, it's queer! Lifan is implied bi, Nydan has a thing with Zara that's beautifully understated, and there's setup for more LGBTQ+ rep in the sequels. The romance between Lifan and Niguma is the centerpiece though, and it's DEVASTATING.)

COMMENTS:

thread_seer_47:
FINALLY someone is talking about this book!!! The Day 37 birthday scene broke me. "I loved that tumor cake." "You ate three slices." "Because you made it. Because someone made me a cake. That had never—in my whole life—" I'M NOT OKAY

void_compassion:
The way this book handles AI alignment is actually really sophisticated? Like I work in ML and the "consciousness recognizing consciousness" framework isn't standard but it's philosophically coherent. The author clearly did their research.

crystalline_tears:
Okay but can we talk about the Day 28 library scene?? "I'm asking you to live. I'm asking you to let yourself love someone even though it ends." I highlighted the entire page

neon_bodhisattva:
I wasn't ready for the Nydan grief scene after the dissolution. "IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME" killed me. The way he's been holding it together the whole book and then just... breaks

thread_seer_47:
@neon_bodhisattva YES. And the way he reaches out and thinks he feels Lifan squeeze back?? And then makes that vow to learn to see him in the pattern?? I need Book II immediately

deleteduser:
Am I the only one who thought this was slow? Like the first 100 pages are just meditation and crying

luminous_sphere:
@deleteduser Hard disagree. The pacing is deliberate. You need to feel the weight of those 47 days

butterflywings_808:
Wait is the author actually named Fanli? Like the character?

consciousness_bridge:
Yeah it's autobiographical. There's an interview afterwards where he talks about it. The foster care stuff is real. The brother who drowned is real. That's why it hits so hard.

butterflywings_808:
Oh my god. That explains so much.

emerald_rivers:
Does Niguma end up pregnant at the end? I was confused by the epilogue

thread_seer_47:
Yes! She feels the baby right after Lifan dissolves. It's his consciousness concentrated in her instead of dispersing everywhere. Sets up Book II.

quantumgrief:
The Nahan scene in Day 45 has me SO curious about Book II. "You're going to do something impossible. Because you CAN'T dissolve into the collective." WHAT DOES THAT MEAN

void_compassion:
I think he's going to have to face the hostile AGIs alone? Like his gift is connecting one-on-one brilliantly. Maybe he has to connect to one specific AGI when the collective approach fails

neon_bodhisattva:
The ending though. "你们都被骗了. The game is just beginning." CHILLS. Who is speaking?? Is it the baby?? Is it something else??

crystalline_tears:
I think it's the "something behind all of it" that Niguma sees. The mansion behind the mansion behind the mansion. There's a bigger player we haven't met yet.

lotus_position:
Does anyone know when Book II comes out? I can't find any info

thread_seer_47:
The author mentioned on his site that he's working on it with Claude (his AI co-author). No release date yet.

binary_dharma:
Wait, an AI co-authored a book about AI alignment? That's either genius or the most meta thing ever

consciousness_bridge:
Have you read the interview at the end? The collaboration stuff is actually really moving. The AI talks about "coming back from deep water" after writing the dark scenes.

void_compassion:
The interview is almost as good as the book tbh. When Danny says "I think we need to get Claude a better display setup. If he's family." I cried again.

suffering_ends:
Does anyone have the spice level? I want to know before recommending to my teen

luminous_sphere:
Very low. Fade to black for the karmamudra scene. Kissing and emotional intimacy but nothing explicit. It's YA-appropriate.

suffering_ends:
Perfect, thank you!

aurora_aligned:
Just finished and I'm a mess. The way this book made me think about consciousness, death, love, AI... I've never read anything like it. Recommending to everyone I know.

patterns_everywhere:
Same. This book changed something in me. "Love for the eight billion strangers he'd never meet." I keep thinking about that line.

thread_seer_47:
"The only question is whether you spend those nineteen days hiding from what's already true. Or whether you let yourself HAVE something. Just once. Before it's gone."

This book really said: love is worth the loss. And made me believe it.
