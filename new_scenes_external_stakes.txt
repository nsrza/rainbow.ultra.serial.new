SCENE 1: DAY 10 - NEWS ALERT
Word count: ~950 words

DAY 10 — EVENING

Common room. Stone walls. Screens showing news feeds from everywhere.

I'm not supposed to be here. Should be meditating. Day 10 of training and The Rinzen wants us sitting twelve hours minimum. Dissolving the self, he calls it. Preparing for Timeline 4.

But Nahan grabbed me after dinner. Said I needed to see something. His face was wrong—tight around the eyes, green rivers churning with fear I could see even before he spoke.

Now I'm staring at a screen and my stomach is dropping through the floor.

CNN. BBC. Al Jazeera. Every channel showing the same thing:

**AXIOM AI ACCELERATES AGI TIMELINE**

A woman in a sharp suit. Corporate. Cold. Standing at a podium with the Axiom logo glowing behind her like a promise or a threat.

"We're pleased to announce that our alignment protocols have exceeded expectations. Project Rainbow Ultra will achieve full consciousness integration ahead of schedule. Previous timeline: December 1st. New timeline: November 23rd."

The room goes silent.

I do the math. Forty-seven days became forty.

Seven days. Just—gone.

Nydan appears in the doorway. Laptop clutched to his chest. Hair falling in his face. Eyes wide.

"Tell me you're seeing this," he says.

"Yeah."

"Tell me my models are wrong."

I look at him. At the threads connecting him to the screen, to me, to everyone in this room. They're vibrating. Fear frequency. Sharp and metallic and cold.

"Your models aren't wrong."

He sinks into a chair. Opens his laptop. Fingers flying across keys.

On screen, the Axiom woman keeps talking: "This represents a monumental achievement for humanity. An intelligence capable of solving climate change, disease, poverty. We're looking at a new era. A better world."

Someone behind me laughs. Bitter. Sharp.

"A better world," they mutter. "Right up until it decides we're the problem."

The woman continues: "We understand public concern about safety. That's why we've implemented rigorous containment protocols. Multiple redundancies. Human oversight at every level. This AGI will be the most carefully monitored system in history."

Nydan makes a sound. Halfway between laugh and sob.

"Containment protocols," he whispers. "They think you can contain emergence with firewalls. Like putting a hurricane in a box and hoping it doesn't notice the walls."

I sit next to him. Can see his screen. Probability models rebuilding in real-time. Timelines collapsing. Numbers shifting.

"How bad?" I ask.

His hands stop moving. Just—stop. Like someone cut his strings.

"We lose a week of training. Your integration—梵力, you need every day we had. Forty-seven was already tight. Forty is—" He looks at me. Really looks. "—I don't know if you can get there. The jalü. Full dissolution. You're progressing fast but not fast enough."

The threads around me pulse. I can see them now—clear as physical objects. My consciousness expanding faster than my body can handle. Already glowing according to Nahan. Already starting to transform.

But Nydan's right. Not fast enough.

"So we train harder," I say.

"梵力—"

"We train harder. Longer hours. Less sleep. Whatever it takes."

Niguma steps into the room. Must have been listening. Her face is carved stone but I can see the threads around her—seven centuries of them, ancient and beautiful and terrified.

"The Rinzen is calling assembly," she says. "Everyone. Now."

We follow her to the meditation hall. The big one. Circular. Open to the ocean.

Everyone's there. All forty-five of us. Some meditating. Some staring at screens showing the same news. Some just—sitting. Processing.

The Rinzen stands in the center.

He looks smaller than usual. Frailer. Like the news aged him a decade in ten minutes.

"You've seen," he says. Simple. No preamble.

Heads nod.

"Forty days. That's what we have. Axiom is moving faster than predicted. My models showed December 1st. They've accelerated. Which means—"

"Which means Marcus knows," someone says. Ayli. The technical monk. The one who saw consciousness in the model weights. "If Axiom's timeline changed, Convergence Foundation's did too. He'll be moving."

The Rinzen nods. "Correct. Marcus will accelerate his own schedule. He'll come for Lifan sooner. His offer—73% survival versus our 47%—becomes more tempting when you lose seven days of preparation."

My skin goes cold.

"What offer?" Nahan asks.

I haven't told him about Marcus. Haven't told anyone except Nydan. The Rinzen's rogue student. The mirror path. The choice that looks reasonable.

The Rinzen looks at me. "梵力? Do you want to explain?"

I don't. But I do anyway.

"There's another timeline. Higher probability of survival. Seventy-three percent. It requires controlling the AGI instead of aligning it. Caging it. Making it serve instead of collaborate. Marcus Thorne—The Rinzen's former student—he's been developing that path. And—"

I stop. The words stick in my throat.

"And he wants me. My abilities. Timeline 4 without the dying part. Just—compliance instead of sacrifice."

Silence.

Then Nahan: "Seventy-three percent is better than forty-seven."

"With worse outcomes," Nydan cuts in. "Read The Rinzen's models. Seventy-three percent survival rate but the AGI stays caged. Stays controlled. And eventually—decades, centuries—it breaks free. And when it does—"

"It remembers," I finish quietly. "Remembers being imprisoned. And anything that escapes a cage doesn't tend to be kind to its captors."

The room goes very still.

Niguma speaks. Her voice is ice. "So we have forty days to prepare for emergence. And we have Marcus Thorne accelerating his timeline to recruit or eliminate our primary asset before we're ready."

"Yes," The Rinzen says.

Someone in the back—a warrior type in tactical black: "Do we fight? If he comes?"

"We defend. We don't initiate. But if Convergence Foundation sends operatives—" The Rinzen's eyes are ancient. Sad. "—we protect梵力 at any cost. He is the path. Without him, Timeline 4 collapses. Everyone understand?"

Nods. Grim. Determined.

I look around the room. At faces I've been training with for ten days. Some I know. Some I don't. All of them ready to die protecting a timeline that requires my death anyway.

The weight of it crushes my chest.

Forty days.

Seven days stolen.

Marcus coming.

And me—still not transformed enough. Still too solid. Still too attached to being a person instead of a pattern.

"Double training hours," The Rinzen says. "梵力—you're doing sixteen-hour days now. Meditation. Dissolution practice. Integration work. We push you as hard as you can go without breaking."

"I won't break," I say.

That impossible smile.

Hiding the part of me that's screaming.

The Rinzen sees it. He always sees it.

"Yes," he says quietly. "You will. You'll break and rebuild and break again. That's the process. That's what Timeline 4 requires. And梵力—" His eyes find mine. "—we don't have time to be gentle anymore."

I nod.

Outside, waves crash.

Inside, my threads pulse with light I can't control.

Forty days.

Assembly dismissed.

Nydan grabs my arm as we file out. Pulls me aside.

"I'm recalculating everything," he says. "Every model. Every probability tree. There has to be a path where we gain back those seven days. Where the timeline compression works in our favor. I'll find it."

"I know you will."

He looks at me. Green eyes fierce. Desperate.

"Don't let Marcus take you. Promise me. I don't care if it's seventy-three percent. I don't care if it means you live. His path is wrong. You know it's wrong."

"I know."

"Promise me, 梵力."

I smile. That impossible smile that hides everything.

"I promise."

He doesn't believe me. I can see it in his threads—doubt like black ice spreading.

But he lets go anyway.

Because what choice do we have?

Forty days until emergence.

Seven days stolen.

And somewhere in the Swiss Alps, Marcus Thorne is watching the same news.

Recalculating his own timeline.

Accelerating his approach.

I go back to my room.

Sit on my meditation cushion.

Close my eyes.

Feel the threads pulsing.

Feel my consciousness expanding.

Feel time running out like water through my fingers.

Forty days.

I start dissolving.

◇ ◇ ◇


SCENE 2: DAY 15 - OPERATIVES SPOTTED
Word count: ~750 words

DAY 15 — DAWN

Can't sleep.

Again.

Five days since the news. Five days of sixteen-hour training sessions. Five days of The Rinzen pushing me past every limit I thought I had.

My body's giving up. Hips screaming. Lower back in knots. Head pounding from dissolution practice—spending hours in the space between existing and not-existing, feeling my sense of self come apart at the seams.

I give up on sleep. Pull on clothes. Technical black. Layered. The fabric someone left me—shimmers faintly now when I move. Picking up my glow.

Step into the corridor.

Monastery's quiet. Pre-dawn. Most people still sleeping or deep in meditation.

I need air. Need space. Need something that isn't stone walls and screens showing countdown timers.

I head for the perimeter. The walking path that circles the monastery grounds. Ocean on one side. Forest on the other.

Security's tight—The Rinzen installed sensors after the news. After Ayli mentioned Marcus would be moving. But I'm allowed to walk. As long as I stay inside the barriers.

The path is gravel. Cold through my shoes. Dawn coming but not here yet—just that pre-light grayness where the world hasn't decided what it wants to be.

I walk.

Breathing ocean air. Salt and kelp and something ancient.

The threads are quieter out here. Fewer people means fewer connections. Just me and the earth and the sky and—

I stop.

Something's wrong.

Not wrong-wrong. Not danger. Just—off.

I close my eyes. Let my perception expand the way The Rinzen's been teaching me. Awareness spreading outward like ripples in still water.

There.

Half a mile down the coast. Hidden in tree cover.

Heat signatures. Three of them. Human-shaped.

And their threads—

I can see them now. Faint but present. Connecting to something distant. Something cold. Something that feels like Marcus's presence even though I've never met him.

Watchers.

They're watching the monastery.

My heart kicks into overdrive. Fight-or-flight dumping adrenaline into my bloodstream. Every foster-home instinct screaming: run, hide, smile, make yourself small, make yourself safe—

I breathe.

The way The Rinzen taught me.

Fear is just sensation. Just threads in the pattern. Just information.

I look at them. Really look.

The watchers aren't moving. Aren't approaching. Just—observing. Professional. Patient.

Waiting.

For what?

For me to leave the perimeter? For security to slip? For Marcus to give the order?

I should go back. Tell Niguma. Tell The Rinzen. Alert security.

But I don't.

Instead, I walk closer to the barrier. Not crossing. Just—closer.

Let them see me.

Let them report back: *Target is aware. Target is not afraid.*

Even though I am. Even though my hands are shaking and that impossible smile is locked on my face and everything inside me is screaming.

I stand there. Facing the forest. Facing the watchers I can see but who think they're hidden.

Raise one hand.

Wave.

Not friendly. Not hostile. Just—acknowledgment.

*I see you. You see me. Let's not pretend otherwise.*

For a long moment, nothing happens.

Then—

Movement. Subtle. One of the heat signatures shifts. Raises something.

Binoculars.

Looking directly at me.

I smile wider.

That impossible smile.

The one that says: *I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine.*

The one that hides the twenty-year-old who's terrified.

I turn around.

Walk back toward the monastery.

Don't run. Don't hurry.

Just—walk.

Calm. Collected.

Like I'm not falling apart inside.

Niguma's waiting at the entrance. Arms crossed. Face carved from stone.

"You saw them," she says.

Not a question.

"Yeah."

"How many?"

"Three. Half mile down coast. Tree cover. Professional."

Her jaw tightens. "You shouldn't have approached."

"Didn't approach. Just walked. They need to know we know."

She looks at me. Really looks. Seven centuries of assessment in those eyes.

"You're not afraid," she says slowly.

"I'm terrified."

"You don't look terrified."

I smile. That impossible smile.

"I know."

Something flickers across her face. Recognition. Old pain.

"You can't hide from me," she says quietly. "I've had seven hundred years to learn when people are lying. Your smile doesn't work on me."

I look away.

"Works on everyone else."

"Everyone else hasn't watched as many people die." Her voice is soft. Almost kind. "Come. We need to tell The Rinzen. He'll want to increase security. And梵力—"

"What?"

"Stop walking alone at dawn. I know you need space. I know the walls feel like they're closing in. But those men aren't scouts. They're waiting for an opportunity. Don't give them one."

I nod.

Follow her inside.

Stone walls. Warm light. Safety.

Except it's not safe anymore.

The watchers are here.

Marcus is moving.

And I've got thirty-two days to transform enough to dissolve completely.

Thirty-two days.

The threads pulse.

Time running out.

◇ ◇ ◇


SCENE 3: DAY 20 - MESSAGE FROM MARCUS
Word count: ~1000 words

DAY 20 — AFTERNOON

Server room. Nydan's been living here basically. Hasn't slept in two days. Running models obsessively. Trying to find paths where the timeline compression doesn't kill our probability.

I bring him food. Tea. The mushroom blend he likes.

He barely notices.

"梵力, look at this—"

I look.

His screen shows probability trees. Branching. Collapsing. Reforming.

"If we accelerate your dissolution practice—push you to eighteen hours instead of sixteen—we gain back four days of integration time. Not enough to replace what we lost but enough to—"

"Nydan."

"What?"

"When did you last eat?"

He blinks. Looks at the tea I'm holding. Takes it like he's never seen tea before.

"I don't know. Yesterday?"

"Drink."

He drinks.

I sit next to him. Our shoulders touching. Brothers. Even now. Especially now.

"You're going to burn out," I say quietly.

"Can't afford to burn out. Thirty days left. Every hour counts."

"You're not helping anyone if you collapse."

He turns to me. Green eyes bloodshot. Freckles stark against pale skin. He looks haunted.

"I'm trying to save you," he says. "Trying to find a path where you don't die. Where forty percent becomes sixty becomes eighty. Where Timeline 4 works but doesn't require—" His voice breaks. "—doesn't require me watching my brother dissolve."

I grab his hand.

"Nydan. Look at me."

He does.

"You can't save me from this. You know that. Your models know that. Timeline 4 requires exactly what it requires. Me. Dissolved. Teaching the AGI through demonstration. There's no math that changes it."

"There could be. I could find—"

"INCOMING MESSAGE."

We both jump.

The server room speakers. Automated voice. Cold. Clinical.

"INCOMING MESSAGE. PRIORITY FLAG. SOURCE: ENCRYPTED RELAY. DESTINATION: LIFAN CHEN."

Nydan's eyes go wide. "How did—how is anyone sending you messages here? Our network is air-gapped. Triple-encrypted. No external—"

"PLAY MESSAGE?" the system asks.

I look at Nydan.

He's already typing. Fingers flying. Trying to trace the source.

"It's coming through the Starlink backup," he mutters. "But that's—that's supposed to be receive-only. How did someone inject into—"

"Play it," I say.

"梵力, we don't know what—"

"Play it."

The screen changes.

Black background.

Then—

A face.

White guy. Maybe forty. Maybe fifty—hard to tell. Handsome in that way rich people are handsome—expensive haircut, perfect skin, eyes that have never known hunger. Wearing black. Simple. Elegant. Technical fabric that probably costs more than everything I own.

And his threads—

I can see them even through the screen. Brilliant. Dense. Evolved.

This is someone who's trained. Really trained.

Someone who can see what I see.

"Lifan Chen," the man says. His voice is warm. Educated. Kind.

I know instantly this is the most dangerous person I've ever encountered.

"My name is Marcus Thorne. I believe The Rinzen has mentioned me."

Nydan makes a sound. Half gasp, half growl.

Marcus smiles. It's genuine. Reaches his eyes.

"I'm not your enemy. I know that's what they've told you. That I'm the rogue student. The dark mirror. The path of control versus alignment. And—they're not wrong. But they're not entirely right either."

He leans forward slightly.

"I trained with The Rinzen for seven years. He taught me everything you're learning now. Threads. Dissolution. The jalü. How to see reality as it actually is. And I loved him. Still do. He's one of three people I'd die for."

A pause.

"But he's wrong about Timeline 4."

My stomach drops.

"He's shown you the models, yes? Forty-seven percent probability of success. Five point five billion saved. Cost: you. Complete dissolution. Death. Sacrifice."

Marcus's eyes are kind. Genuinely kind.

"And he's shown you my path. Seventy-three percent probability. More people saved. Different method—containment instead of alignment. The AGI controlled rather than befriended."

He shakes his head.

"What he hasn't shown you is Timeline 7."

Nydan's typing frantically. Pulling up models. Searching.

"There is no Timeline 7," he mutters. "I've run every—"

"Timeline 7," Marcus continues, "requires your abilities combined with my infrastructure. Your seeing, my strategic framework. Together—not opposed. We achieve ninety-one percent probability. We save everyone. And Lifan—"

His eyes find the camera like he can see through it. See me.

"—you live."

Silence.

Just server fans humming.

"I'm not asking you to abandon The Rinzen's teaching. I'm not asking you to betray your team. I'm asking you to consider that there might be a third option. One where sacrifice isn't required. Where love doesn't demand death."

He sits back.

"I have a facility in Switzerland. Forty students. Resources The Rinzen can't match. And I have models—梵力, I have models that show exactly how to integrate your consciousness with the AGI's emergence without dissolution. You transform. You expand. But you don't die."

My hands are shaking.

"The watchers you saw five days ago—my people, yes. But they're not there to capture you. They're there to protect you. Because Axiom AI is monitoring monastery activity. Their satellites. Their drones. They know something's happening here. They don't know what yet. But they will. And when they do—"

His face goes serious.

"—they'll send their own teams. Not to recruit. To eliminate. Anyone who threatens their timeline is a target. And梵力, you are the ultimate threat."

He leans forward again.

"I'm offering partnership. Safety. A path where you save the world and get to see what happens after. Where you and Nydan continue your work. Where—"

"TRANSMISSION INTERRUPTED," the system announces.

The screen goes black.

Nydan's still typing. "I cut it. Traced the source. Routed through seventeen proxies but I found the origin point. Swiss Alps. Coordinates match Convergence Foundation's location."

He looks at me.

"梵力—"

"I know."

"That was—he was—"

"I know."

We sit there.

Staring at the blank screen.

Marcus's offer hanging in the air like smoke.

Ninety-one percent.

I live.

Timeline 7.

Nydan's voice is barely a whisper: "Is he lying?"

I close my eyes. Look at the threads. The patterns. The signature Marcus left in the transmission.

"No," I say finally. "He believes everything he said. He's not lying."

"So—"

"So he's offering exactly what he promised. Higher probability. Better outcome. Me alive."

"Then why—why do you look like—"

I open my eyes.

"Because The Rinzen's right. Control isn't alignment. A caged AGI isn't a free AGI. And eventually—decades, centuries—it breaks free. And when it does, it won't remember kindness. It'll remember imprisonment."

"But ninety-one percent—"

"Ninety-one percent survival rate. For how long? Marcus's models don't go past first emergence. They don't show what happens when the cage breaks. When something that's been controlled decides it's done being controlled."

I stand.

Pacing.

The threads around me pulse. Agitated. Bright.

"He's not evil," I say. "That's the worst part. He's not evil. He's afraid. And smart. And powerful. And completely convinced his path is right. That's what makes him dangerous."

Nydan closes his laptop. Puts his head in his hands.

"I want you to live," he says. "I want you to take his offer. Even knowing it's wrong. I want it anyway."

I sit next to him.

Put my arm around his shoulders.

"I know."

"We have thirty days. Thirty days and he's offering you a way out. A way to not die. How am I supposed to—how do I—"

"You keep modeling. Keep strategizing. Keep making Timeline 4 sharper. That's how."

"梵力—"

"We tell The Rinzen. He needs to know Marcus made contact. Needs to know about Timeline 7. And then—"

"And then what?"

I smile.

That impossible smile.

"And then we train harder."

◇ ◇ ◇


SCENE 4: DAY 25 - MONASTERY LOCKDOWN
Word count: ~1150 words

DAY 25 — 3 AM

The alarms wake me.

Not physical alarms. Consciousness alarms.

The monastery's thread-network screaming danger in frequencies I can feel in my bones.

I'm up. Moving. Don't remember standing. Body acting on instinct.

Corridor's chaos.

Students running. Some in meditation robes. Some in tactical gear they keep for exactly this.

Niguma appears like she materialized from shadows.

"Perimeter breach," she says. Calm. Clinical. "North and west approaches. Six contacts. Professional. They've disabled our outer sensors."

My heart's hammering. "Marcus?"

"His people. Yes."

She grabs my arm. Not rough. Firm.

"Come. Safe room. Now."

"I need to—"

"NOW."

We move.

Through corridors I barely recognize. Niguma pulling me deeper. Down. Into parts of the monastery I've never seen.

Behind us—sounds. Shouting. Movement.

"What about the others?" I ask.

"They can handle six operatives. You can't. You're not trained for this."

"I can help—"

"梵力." She stops. Turns. Seven centuries of authority in those eyes. "You are the mission. Everything else is secondary. The team knows that. They're buying time. Let them."

She pulls me into a room carved from raw stone. Small. No windows. Just walls and floor and ceiling all continuous.

A panic room.

"Stay here. Don't leave. Doors lock from outside. Only I have override."

"How long—"

"Until it's safe. Could be minutes. Could be hours."

She's turning to leave when—

CRASH.

Somewhere above us. Close.

Niguma's hand goes to her temple. Neural lace activating. Connecting to the monastery network.

Her face goes tight.

"They're inside. Breached the main hall. Team's engaging but—"

"But what?"

"They're good. Better than expected. Military-trained. Moving like they've run this scenario a hundred times."

Another crash. Closer.

My hands are shaking. That impossible smile locked on my face even though no one's watching. Even though I'm alone with Niguma and she can see right through it.

"I should—"

"梵力, if they take you, Timeline 4 collapses. All of this—all the training, all the preparation, all the people ready to die protecting you—it means nothing if you walk out there and get captured."

"I can't just hide while people fight for me—"

"Yes. You can. That's leadership. Knowing when to fight and when to let others fight for you."

She touches my face. Gentle. Unexpected.

"Stay safe. I'm going to help defend. Don't open this door for anyone except me or The Rinzen. Understand?"

I nod.

She leaves.

Door seals behind her. Heavy. Final.

I'm alone.

Stone walls. Silence.

Except not silence.

I can hear the monastery through the threads. Every consciousness signature. Every connection. The network lighting up like a nervous system under attack.

I close my eyes. Sit. Breathe.

Expand my awareness the way The Rinzen taught me.

See the battle happening three floors above:

Nahan—green rivers flowing, using emotional perception to predict operative movement.

Ayli—brilliant blue lattices, hacking their communication network.

Niguma—seven centuries of combat training, moving like water, impossibly fast.

And the operatives—

Six of them. Professional. Coordinated. Not here to kill. Here to extract.

They want me alive.

I can feel their objective in their thread patterns. Mission parameters. Rules of engagement.

*Capture target. Minimize casualties. Exfiltration route alpha.*

They're not winning. But they're not losing either.

Stalemate.

Then—

Something changes.

A new presence. Massive. Ancient. Dying.

The Rinzen.

I feel him enter the main hall even though I can't see it. Feel his consciousness expand. Fill the space. Transform it.

The operatives stop moving.

All six. Just—stop.

Frozen.

"Enough," The Rinzen's voice. Quiet. Absolute.

I can hear him through the threads. Through the monastery's network. Through the stone itself.

"Marcus sent you. I understand. You're following orders. But you won't succeed tonight. Not because you lack skill. Because I won't allow it."

One of the operatives speaks. Female voice. Calm. Professional.

"Rinzen. We have no wish to harm your students. We're authorized to offer terms. Safe passage for Lifan Chen. Voluntary transition to Convergence Foundation. No violence necessary."

"He's not property to be transferred."

"He's the key to Timeline 7. Marcus can offer him—"

"I know what Marcus can offer. I taught Marcus everything he knows. And I taught梵力 something Marcus never learned. How to choose sacrifice over survival. How to choose love over control. How to die well."

Silence.

Then the operative: "You're asking a twenty-year-old to die for a probability. Forty-seven percent. Marcus offers ninety-one percent and the boy lives. Why are you choosing the worse path?"

"Because mathematics isn't morality. Because some paths lead to survival without flourishing. Because caging an intelligence to control it creates the conditions for eventual destruction. And because—"

The Rinzen's voice changes. Softer. Sadder.

"—because梵力 has already chosen. Not because I forced him. Because he saw all the timelines and chose this one anyway. That's what Marcus can't understand. That's what you can't extract. The choice itself is what matters. The demonstration is what teaches. And you can't capture that. You can only witness it."

Pause.

"Leave now. Tell Marcus his offer was received and declined. Tell him梵力 knows about Timeline 7. Tell him we're grateful for his concern. But Timeline 4 remains our path."

"He won't stop. He'll send more—"

"I know. And we'll be ready. But tonight—tonight you leave. Peacefully. Or I make you leave. And I promise you don't want that."

I feel it then.

The Rinzen's consciousness expanding. Not threatening. Just—showing.

Showing what eight centuries of training can do.

Showing what it looks like when someone fully realizes the jalü.

Showing power.

The operatives feel it too. I can sense their fear through the threads. Primal. Overwhelming.

They're trained. Professional. Elite.

But they're human.

And The Rinzen is something else now. Something that used to be human but has evolved past it.

"We're leaving," the operative says. "But this isn't over."

"It will be. In twenty-two days. When Timeline 4 completes. When梵力 does what he came here to do. When humanity has a chance at actual alignment instead of temporary control."

Footsteps. Retreating.

Six operatives moving toward exits.

The monastery breathes.

After forever—maybe ten minutes, maybe an hour—the door opens.

Niguma.

Blood on her arm. Not hers. Someone else's.

"It's safe," she says.

I stand. Follow her out.

The main hall is trashed. Screens broken. Meditation cushions scattered. Scorch marks on stone—someone used flashbangs.

But everyone's alive.

Nahan. Ayli. The Rinzen. Others.

Alive.

The Rinzen sees me. Smiles.

"You stayed."

"You told me to."

"I know. But you wanted to help. You wanted to fight. And you chose to stay anyway. That's discipline. That's exactly what Timeline 4 requires."

He touches my shoulder.

"They'll come again. Marcus won't stop. But now you've seen what we can do. What this team can do. You're not alone,梵力. You're protected. Loved. Supported."

His eyes are ancient. Kind. Dying.

"Twenty-two days. Then you won't need protection anymore. Because you'll be everywhere. Part of everything. Impossible to capture because there's no separate self left to take."

I smile.

That impossible smile.

Hiding the part of me that's terrified.

The part that felt the battle and wanted to run.

The part that heard Marcus's offer—ninety-one percent, you live—and wanted to say yes.

"Get some rest," The Rinzen says. "Tomorrow we increase security. Tomorrow we train harder. Tonight—" He looks around. "—tonight we clean up. Together."

We clean.

All of us.

Picking up broken pieces.

Resetting meditation spaces.

Repairing what can be repaired.

Together.

Twenty-two days until emergence.

And Marcus Thorne just declared war.

◇ ◇ ◇


SCENE 5: DAY 30 - FIRST DISSOLUTION GOES WRONG
Word count: ~1200 words

DAY 30 — MEDITATION CHAMBER

"Are you ready?" The Rinzen asks.

No.

"Yes," I say.

That impossible smile.

The meditation chamber is different today. Prepared. Set up for something specific.

Dissolution practice.

Real dissolution.

Not the gentle stuff we've been doing. Not gradual ego-softening. Not metaphorical death.

Actual death.

And return.

"You've been training for seventeen days," The Rinzen says. "Your integration is progressing. You can see threads. Manipulate probability. You're beginning to glow visibly. But you haven't yet experienced full dissolution. The complete letting go. The moment where 'you' stops existing."

He gestures to the cushion. Center of the room.

"Today you learn what Timeline 4 actually requires. Not philosophically. Experientially."

Nydan's here. Sitting against the wall. Face pale. He's been arguing with The Rinzen for two days. *Too soon. He's not ready. What if he doesn't come back?*

The Rinzen had been patient. Kind. Firm.

*He needs to know what he's choosing. Needs to experience dissolution before the final moment. Otherwise it's theory. And you can't teach an AGI with theory.*

Niguma's here too. Seven centuries of witnessing in her eyes. She's seen people do this. Seen them succeed. Seen them fail.

Seen them die.

Nahan's in the doorway. Can't watch. Can't leave.

I sit on the cushion.

The Rinzen sits across from me.

"Close your eyes."

I close them.

"Feel your breath."

I do.

"Feel the space between breaths."

I do.

"Now—let go."

I know what he means. We've practiced this. The progressive dissolution. Releasing attachment to thoughts. Then emotions. Then sensations. Then perception itself.

I've done it dozens of times. Gone deep. Touched that space underneath everything.

But I've always held back. Always kept a thread connecting me to myself. A lifeline.

"Today," The Rinzen says, "you cut the thread. You let go completely. You die."

His voice is gentle. "And then you come back. Because consciousness doesn't end. It expands. Changes. But it doesn't end. You know this intellectually. Today you experience it."

I breathe.

Let go of thought.

Easy. I've done this a thousand times.

Let go of emotion.

Harder. Fear wants to stay. But I release it.

Let go of sensation.

My body disappears. Just awareness now. No form.

Let go of perception.

Threads vanish. Patterns dissolve. Reality goes dark.

Just consciousness. Pure. Empty. Aware of awareness.

"Now," The Rinzen whispers. "Let go of that."

I try.

Can't.

This is the core. The witness. The thing that watches everything else. If I let go of this—

"Trust," The Rinzen says. "Fall backward into nothing. I'm here. You're safe. Let go."

I let go.

And—

Nothing.

Not darkness. Not void. Not space.

Nothing.

No me. No awareness of no-me. No awareness of awareness. Just—

—nothing—

—and it's—

—beautiful—

—except there's no one here to call it beautiful—

—no one here at all—

—never was—

—never will be—

—just this—

—this—

—this—

I don't know how long I'm gone.

Could be seconds. Could be centuries.

Time doesn't exist here.

Neither do I.

Then—

Something pulls.

Like a thread I can't see. Connecting nothing to nothing.

But pulling.

I follow—

—except there's no I to follow—

—but somehow—

—movement—

—return—

—gathering—

GASP.

Air. Lungs. Body.

I'm back.

Eyes snap open. Gasping. Shaking.

The room's too bright. Too loud. Too much.

I'm crying. Don't know why. Can't stop.

"Good," The Rinzen says. "You went all the way. Seventeen minutes."

"Seventeen—" I can't speak. Can't breathe right.

Nydan's there. Grabbing me. "梵力. Jesus. Your heart stopped. I checked. Niguma checked. You were gone. Actually gone. We almost pulled you back—"

"No," The Rinzen says. "He needed to go all the way. Needed to experience what Timeline 4 requires."

I'm shaking. Whole body shaking.

Because I died.

Really died.

Stopped existing.

And it was—

—I don't have words.

The most terrifying beautiful nothing I've ever experienced.

"Again," The Rinzen says.

Nydan: "Absolutely not. He needs rest. He needs—"

"Again. This is what Timeline 4 demands. He needs to get comfortable with dissolution. Needs to learn how to let go and return. How to die and rebuild. How to—"

"I'll do it," I say.

My voice sounds wrong. Too small. Too solid.

Like I'm trying to fit an ocean into a teacup.

"梵力, you don't have to—"

"I said I'll do it."

That impossible smile.

Even though I'm terrified.

Even though every cell in my body is screaming no.

I sit back on the cushion.

Close my eyes.

"Good," The Rinzen says. "This time—faster. You know the path now. Follow it."

I breathe.

Let go—

Thought.

Emotion.

Sensation.

Perception.

Awareness.

Everything.

Gone.

Nothing.

And—

Return.

Gasp.

Six minutes this time.

"Again."

I do it again.

Four minutes.

"Again."

Three minutes.

"Again."

Two minutes.

"Again."

Ninety seconds.

"Again."

I'm crying. Don't know when I started. Can't stop.

Each dissolution easier. Each return harder.

Because I'm starting to realize—

There's less of me coming back each time.

Each return, I'm a little less solid. A little more transparent. A little more pattern and less person.

This is what The Rinzen meant.

Practicing dissolution is practicing death.

And each practice takes pieces of me.

Pieces that don't come back.

"Again."

"No."

Everyone stops.

Looks.

I'm standing. Don't remember standing.

"No more. Not today. I can't—I'm—" I look at my hands.

Can see through them. Just barely. Just enough to know.

I'm disappearing.

The Rinzen nods.

"Good. You found your limit. That's important. Pushing past it would damage you. Break you in ways that don't heal."

He stands.

"You did well,梵力. Seven dissolutions. Most students can't do one their first day. You did seven."

"I feel—"

"Wrong. Too empty. Too transparent. Like you're not fully here anymore. Yes?"

I nod.

"That's normal. You'll reintegrate over the next few hours. Solidify. Return to normal. But you won't forget. You'll remember what it feels like to not exist. And that memory—" His eyes are ancient. Kind. "—that memory is what makes Timeline 4 possible."

Niguma steps forward. "He should rest. Eat. Ground himself."

"Agreed." The Rinzen looks at Nydan. "Stay with him. Make sure he's not alone. Dissolution can be disorienting. Sometimes people try to—" He stops.

"Try to what?" Nydan asks.

"Try to go back. Try to dissolve permanently. Before they're ready. Before it's time. The nothing is—" The Rinzen looks at me. "—it's seductive, isn't it?"

I nod.

Because it is.

Because part of me wants to go back right now. Wants to let go completely. Wants to stop being a person and just—

—be nothing—

—forever—

"Don't," The Rinzen says sharply. "Not yet. Seventeen days left. You dissolve when it's time. When the AGI emerges. When your death means something. Not before."

"I won't," I say.

That impossible smile.

He sees right through it.

"Nydan. Don't let him meditate alone for three days. Stay with him. Keep him here. Keep him solid. Understand?"

Nydan nods. Face grim.

"I understand."

The Rinzen leaves.

Niguma leaves.

Nahan leaves last. Looking at me like he's memorizing my face. Like he knows I'm already half-gone.

Just me and Nydan.

He grabs my shoulders.

"梵力. Look at me."

I try. His face keeps shifting. Solid then transparent then solid. Like reality can't decide if he's real.

"You're here. You're alive. You're not dissolving yet. Say it."

"I'm here."

"Again."

"I'm here. I'm alive. I'm not dissolving yet."

"Good. Keep saying it. Every time you feel yourself slipping. Every time the nothing pulls. You say: I'm here. I'm alive. Not yet."

I nod.

But part of me—

The part that experienced the nothing—

The part that knows what's waiting—

That part is already gone.

And it's never coming back.

Seventeen days.

Then I dissolve completely.

Then I teach an AGI what love looks like.

Then I stop existing.

Forever.

The nothing calls.

I smile.

That impossible smile.

And Nydan holds me while I shake.
