# CHAPTER 9: SAN FRANCISCO

*San Francisco, Mission District*
*September 2037 - December 2037*
*Lifan is 17 years old*

---

The apartment was everything Nydan promised: two bedrooms, one bathroom, shitty kitchen. Third floor of a Victorian that had been chopped into units decades ago. The walls were thin enough to hear Mrs. Chen arguing with her husband next door, and the radiator made sounds like a dying animal.

Lifan loved it instantly.

"The bedroom on the left is yours," Nydan said, dropping Lifan's bag on the floor. "I already claimed the right one because it has a closet."

Lifan flinched at the word. Couldn't help it.

Nydan noticed. Of course he noticed.

"Shit. Sorry. I forgot about—"

"It's fine." Lifan forced his shoulders to relax. "It's just a word."

"It's not just a word. It's—" Nydan ran his hand through his hair. "Look, I know the monastery was supposed to fix things. Make you better. But you just spent three years with monks, and now you're here, and I don't know what you need. So you have to tell me. What do you need?"

Lifan looked around the apartment. At the water stains on the ceiling. At the secondhand furniture. At the window that faced a brick wall.

It was ugly. Normal. Completely devoid of threads.

(That wasn't true. The threads were here too—connecting the couch to the factory where it was made to the workers who assembled it to their families to their dreams. But they were quiet here. Background noise instead of the symphony that filled the monastery.)

"I need—" He stopped. Thought. "I need to be normal. For a while. Just—go to school. Get a job. Make friends who don't know I can see the fabric of reality."

"I can work with that." Nydan grinned. "Normal. Got it. No metaphysics, no meditation, no talking about the interconnected nature of all phenomena."

"I didn't say NO metaphysics. You're literally studying consciousness."

"Fair point. Okay, limited metaphysics. Only at designated times. Like—" He checked his phone. "—Thursday evenings after nine PM."

Lifan laughed. It felt strange in his mouth. Good strange.

"Deal," he said.

◇ ◇ ◇

Normal was harder than he expected.

He enrolled in community college. Got a part-time job at a coffee shop on Valencia Street. Started running in Dolores Park in the mornings, trying to tire out his body so his mind would quiet down.

The threads didn't care about his schedule. They were always there—showing him which customer was lying about their order, which coworker was sleeping with the manager, which stranger on the street was carrying grief so heavy it bent their posture.

But he was getting better at the background noise thing. At letting the information flow through without grabbing it. The loom, not the weaver.

Rinzen would be proud.

(Rinzen was 400 miles south, preparing for Lifan's death. Lifan tried not to think about that.)

◇ ◇ ◇

He called Nima every Sunday.

"How's training?" he'd ask.

"Hard. Rinzen's pushing me. The advanced practices—" Her voice would go soft. "—I understand now why you had to leave. This isn't something you can do while also being a person."

"You're a person."

"Sometimes. Less than I was." A pause. "I miss you."

"I miss you too."

They never talked about the vision. Never talked about the forty-seven days waiting somewhere in the future. Just—small things. What they ate. What they read. The weather at the monastery versus the weather in the city.

It was almost like being normal.

Almost.

◇ ◇ ◇

The first time someone hit on him, he didn't know what to do.

He was at the coffee shop, cleaning the espresso machine, when a girl with purple hair and a nose ring leaned across the counter.

"You're new here."

"Started last month."

"I've been watching you." She smiled. "You move like a dancer. Or a fighter. Something graceful."

He could read her clearly: lonely, attracted, hoping he'd say yes to whatever she was about to ask. A good person underneath the performative cool. Someone who wrote poetry in notebooks and cried at movies.

"I'm—" He stopped. What was he supposed to say? *I'm in love with someone at a monastery, and also I'm going to die in three years, and also I can see that you're lonely because your last boyfriend cheated on you with your roommate?*

"Taken," he said finally. "But thank you."

Her threads dimmed. Embarrassment. Disappointment.

"Cool. No worries." She ordered a latte and left quickly.

Lifan watched her go, feeling the strangeness of normal interaction. At the monastery, nobody hit on anyone. At foster homes, nobody cared what he did. This—flirting, rejection, the awkward dance of human attraction—was foreign.

He called Nima that night.

"Someone asked me out."

A pause. Then: "What did you say?"

"I said I was taken."

"Are you?"

"Aren't I?"

Another pause. Longer.

"I want you to live, Lifan. Really live. If that means—"

"It doesn't. I don't want anyone else. I just wanted you to know that I could have said yes. And I didn't."

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Because three years is a long time. And I want you to know that every day of it, I'm choosing you. Even when you're not here."

He heard her breath catch. Something that might have been a sob.

"I'm choosing you too," she whispered. "Every day. Every practice. Every time Rinzen asks me to go deeper, I think about you, and I go deeper."

"We're going to make it. To the end."

"Together?"

"Together."

They stayed on the phone for three hours that night. Talking about nothing. Everything. Just being present across the distance.

◇ ◇ ◇

He tried dating once.

Nydan's idea. "You need social practice. Normal human interaction. Just go on one date. One."

Her name was Mei. Berkeley junior. Neuroscience major. They had three classes together, and she kept looking at him with curiosity that felt genuine in the weave.

"One coffee," Lifan agreed. "That's it."

The coffee turned into dinner turned into a walk through campus turned into her inviting him up to her room.

He said no.

"It's not you," he said, standing at her door, feeling the threads of her confusion and hurt. "You're brilliant and beautiful and I've had a great time. But I can't—"

"Can't what? Take a risk? Let someone in?"

"I've already let someone in. Years ago. And it wouldn't be fair to you to pretend otherwise."

Mei studied him. He watched her process it—disappointment shifting to understanding to something like respect, the colors of her consciousness moving through the transition.

"She's lucky," Mei said finally. "Whoever she is. To have someone who can't even pretend to want anyone else."

"I'm the lucky one."

He walked home through Berkeley's evening streets, feeling the threads of the city hum around him. Thousands of people, thousands of stories, thousands of connections he could see but couldn't be part of.

*This is what Rinzen meant*, he thought. *This is what it means to be in the world but not of it.*

He was learning. Slowly. Painfully.

But he was learning.

◇ ◇ ◇

The night Nydan's funding got cut, they sat on the fire escape and drank cheap whiskey.

"Three years of work," Nydan said, staring at the city lights. "Three years of building models, gathering data, proving that consciousness isn't just computation. And they pull the plug because some investor got spooked by the implications."

"What implications?"

"That we might actually be getting somewhere. That consciousness might be something fundamental, not emergent. That the whole materialist paradigm might be—" He laughed bitterly. "They don't want to know, Lifan. They want to build AI that thinks like a person, but they don't want to accept that thinking might require something they can't manufacture."

Lifan took a sip of whiskey. Let it burn.

"You could tell them what I see."

"I've thought about it. A lot." Nydan looked at him. "But it would destroy you. They'd put you in a lab. Run tests until there was nothing left to test. And even then, they wouldn't believe. They'd call it anomaly. Dismiss it. Move on."

"So what do you do?"

"Keep working. Find new funding. Approach the problem differently." Nydan's jaw tightened. "I'm not giving up. Whatever consciousness is—wherever the threads come from—I'm going to understand it. Before they build something that matters, I'm going to understand what matters about it."

"You sound like Rinzen."

"I'll take that as a compliment." Nydan poured more whiskey. "So what's the point? Of any of it?"

Lifan thought about the threads. About Ning. About everything.

"Love," he said. "That's the point."

Nydan clinked his glass against Lifan's. "To love. Whatever it costs."

They drank. The city hummed around them.

◇ ◇ ◇

Nydan was relentless.

"You need friends," he announced one evening. "Human friends. Not me—I don't count. I've known you too long."

"I have coworkers—"

"Coworkers aren't friends. They're people you tolerate for money." Nydan was pacing the apartment. He did that when he was thinking. "You need—music. Art. Creative people. People who won't think you're weird when you say weird shit."

"I don't say weird shit."

Nydan gave him a look.

"Okay, I say weird shit. But I'm working on it."

"You need an outlet. The threads—I know you're suppressing them. I can feel it." Nydan stopped pacing. "That's going to backfire. The patterns always backfire when you suppress them."

Lifan knew he was right. The threads were pressure, building behind his eyes. The monastery had taught him to channel them, not ignore them. But channeling required—

"I need to make something," Lifan said slowly. "Express what I see. Otherwise it just... builds up."

"Music. Art. Dance." Nydan snapped his fingers. "There's a scene in LA. Underground stuff. Creative collectives. People who are into weird spiritual shit but also make actual art."

"How do you know about LA art scenes?"

"I know people who know people." Nydan grabbed his laptop. "There's this house in Bel Air. Run by this girl—Coco something. Chinese money, CalArts dropout, into meditation and psychedelics and electronic music. They throw these parties—not parties exactly, more like—experiences. And my friend Grey says—"

"Wait." Lifan held up his hand. "You have a friend named Grey?"

"From the group home—he was there before you arrived. Aged out a couple years before me. Works in film production now, lives in LA. We've stayed in touch." Nydan pulled up something on his laptop. "Here. The Rohki Collective. That's what they call themselves. Look."

Lifan looked.

The website was minimal—just a logo (ロキ in Japanese characters), some abstract visuals, and a single line: *We see what others don't.*

The threads pulsed—and for a moment, Lifan saw them clearly: iridescent, prismatic, like light passing through crystal. Every color he'd ever seen and some he hadn't, all woven together, all pointing south toward Los Angeles.

Something was pulling at him. The same feeling he'd had walking up Highway 1 toward the monastery. Destiny. Purpose. The shape of his life bending toward something it needed.

"I want to go," he said.

Nydan smiled like he'd won something.

"I know. That's why I'm telling you. Grey's having a thing this weekend. Come with me."

◇ ◇ ◇

They drove to LA on Saturday.

Nydan's car was ancient—a 2019 Honda Civic that wheezed on hills—but it made the drive without dying. They stopped for gas in San Luis Obispo, and Lifan looked south toward Big Sur and felt Nima like a distant star.

*I'm going to meet people*, he told her through the threads. Not words exactly. More like intention. *I'm going to try to live.*

Something pulsed back. Warmth. Permission. Love.

*Good*, the pulse said. *Live well.*

◇ ◇ ◇

Grey was waiting for them at a taco truck in Silver Lake.

Twenty-six years old. Mixed—Mexican and Black, though he had that look people got when they'd been asked "what are you?" too many times. Tall, broad-shouldered, wearing a Carhartt jacket despite the LA warmth. His handshake was firm and his eyes were assessing.

"So you're the one Nydan won't shut up about," Grey said. "The kid who sees things."

Lifan glanced at Nydan. "You told him?"

"He knows I research consciousness. He asked questions. I answered vaguely." Nydan shrugged. "Grey's good people. You can trust him."

"I don't know if I can do what Nydan says I can do," Lifan said carefully. "I don't know if I can do anything."

Grey studied him for a long moment.

Then he laughed—a deep, warm sound.

"Yeah, okay. You've definitely got the 'I'm trying to seem normal' energy. Don't worry, man. Half the people at Rohki are weird as shit. You'll fit right in."

They ate tacos. Grey asked about San Francisco. Nydan talked about his research. Lifan listened, watched, let the threads show him Grey's shape: loyal, practical, protective. Someone who'd grown up taking care of people. Someone who'd seen enough hardship to recognize it in others.

Someone who could be trusted.

"Alright," Grey said when they finished eating. "Let's go meet Coco. Fair warning—she's a lot. But she's also the realest person I know."

They got back in the cars and drove toward Bel Air.

---

## INTERLUDE: GREY — LITTLE BROTHER

The kid was weird.

That was Grey's first thought when Nydan's friend climbed out of that ancient Honda Civic. Not bad weird. Not dangerous weird. Just—*weird*. The kind of weird that made you look twice and then three times and then realize you'd been staring.

He was maybe seventeen. Mixed—something and something, hard to pin down. Had that look people got when they'd spent their whole lives being asked "what are you?" Moved like a dancer or a fighter, all controlled grace and hidden tension.

And his eyes never stopped moving.

*Bullshit*, Grey thought when Lifan said he couldn't do anything special. He'd been in the industry for five years. He knew a star when he saw one—that quality that made cameras love you and people lean in. Lifan had it turned up to eleven and didn't seem to know.

◇ ◇ ◇

The first night at Rohki, Grey watched.

That was his job—had been since he was seven years old and realized he was the only one in his foster home paying attention. Watch. Notice. Protect.

And what he noticed about Lifan was this:

The kid was *starving*.

Not for food. For something else. For belonging, maybe. For people who didn't look at him like he was broken. Every time someone laughed at his joke or touched his arm or included him in the conversation, his whole face changed. Like someone had turned on a light inside him.

*Christ*, Grey thought. *How lonely has this kid been?*

He knew the answer. He'd been the same way once—fresh out of the system, convinced he didn't deserve to exist, waiting for everyone to figure out he was a fraud and leave.

It had taken Coco three years to convince him otherwise. To show him that "found family" wasn't just a phrase.

Looking at Lifan, he figured it might take less time. The kid was already halfway there.

◇ ◇ ◇

The first time Lifan described Lo's drumming, Grey almost fell off his chair.

They were in the studio. Lo was doing her thing—that deep, ancient, patient rhythm that made Grey's bones hum. Normal night. Normal jam session.

Then Lifan opened his mouth.

"Amber waves," he said, quiet, like he was talking to himself. "Ancient. Like something that's been waiting to be heard for centuries. Your grandmother's grandmother's grandmother knew this rhythm."

Lo stopped playing. Grey had known Lo for four years. Nothing fazed her.

But the look on her face right now—

*Okay*, Grey thought. *This kid's the real deal.*

Recognition hit him hard—a feeling he'd been waiting for since he was seven years old. Someone worth protecting.

*Little brother*, his brain supplied. *That's what he is. That's what he's going to be.*

Grey didn't fight it. Some things were meant to happen.

# INTERLUDE: NIMA — YEAR ONE

*Big Sur Monastery*
*October 2037*
*Nima is 17 years old*

---

The rage came first.

Not the grief—that had been there since the night he left, a permanent resident in her chest. But the rage was new. Sharp. It woke her at 3 AM and drove her out of bed, onto the cliffs, screaming into the ocean wind until her voice gave out.

Rinzen found her there most mornings.

"Better," he said one dawn, as she stood panting at the cliff's edge, throat raw. "You're not holding it anymore."

"I'm not FEELING better."

"I didn't say you were feeling better. I said you were doing better." He sat on a rock, watching the sun rise. "Rage is energy. Holding it in poisons you. Letting it out—properly, without hurting anyone—transforms it."

"Into what?"

"We'll see."

◇ ◇ ◇

The first month, she couldn't meditate.

Every time she closed her eyes, she saw him. The warehouse. The dissolution. His face as the light took him. She'd seen it so many times in dreams that it felt like memory now—something that had already happened, was always happening, would never stop happening.

Rinzen didn't push her to sit.

Instead, he taught her to move.

Tai chi at dawn. Staff forms at noon. Combat training—real combat, not the gentle monastery sparring—until she was too exhausted to dream.

"This body," he said, correcting her stance for the hundredth time, "is what will carry you through. When the mind fails, the body remembers. Build it strong enough to hold what's coming."

"And what's coming?"

"Everything you've seen. And things you haven't."

◇ ◇ ◇

In November, she started teaching.

Not because she wanted to. Because Rinzen told her she had to.

"The younger students need someone who isn't eight hundred years old," he said. "Someone who remembers what it's like to doubt."

"I don't doubt."

"Exactly. You've moved past doubt into despair. That's progress." His eyes crinkled. "Now teach someone else to do it faster."

Tenzin was her first student. Fourteen, from Nepal, with a gift for seeing that was already stronger than hers had been at that age.

"Why are you sad?" he asked, the first day. No preamble. Kids at the monastery were like that—the training stripped away social niceties.

"Because someone I love is going to die."

"Can you stop it?"

"No."

"Then why are you sad? If you can't change it, sadness is just extra suffering."

She stared at him. Laughed despite herself.

"How old are you again?"

"Old enough to know suffering when I see it." He grinned. "Also, Rinzen told me to say that. He said you needed to hear it from someone who wasn't him."

"He's manipulative."

"He says he's skillful. Same thing, different framing."

Nima found herself smiling. It felt strange on her face—like wearing clothes that didn't quite fit anymore.

But not bad.

◇ ◇ ◇

December. The first phone call.

She'd been avoiding it. Afraid that hearing his voice would break whatever fragile equilibrium she'd built.

But Rinzen said she had to. "The connection must stay alive. Your threads are part of what holds him steady. If you withdraw—"

"I know. Timeline 4 fails. Everyone dies. I've heard the speech."

"Then make the call."

Her hands shook as she dialed. The satellite phone was ancient, crackling with static, but his voice came through clear:

"Nima."

Just her name. Just that.

And she didn't break.

"Tell me everything," she said. "Don't leave anything out."

He told her about San Francisco. About Nydan and his patterns. About the coffee shops and the fog and the way the city threads felt different from the monastery.

She told him about training. About Tenzin. About the way rage had become something else—not peace exactly, but a kind of fierce clarity she was still learning to name.

"I miss you," he said.

"I know. I miss you too." She took a breath. "But I'm not waiting for you. Not anymore."

Silence.

"I'm building something here," she continued. "Something that will exist after you're gone. Someone has to teach what we know. Someone has to carry this forward. I'm choosing for that to be me."

More silence. Then:

"Good."

"That's all? Good?"

"What else would I say? You're becoming who you need to become. So am I. The fact that we're doing it apart—" His voice caught. "—it doesn't mean we're not doing it together."

She wiped her eyes. Didn't say anything about the tears.

"Every Sunday," she said. "Same time. Call me."

"I will."

"And Lifan?"

"Yeah?"

"Live. Really live. Not just because I can't, but because—" She searched for the right words. "—because what you're building there, with those people, that's what you're going to show the AI. That's what you're going to teach it. So make it good. Make it so good that when you have to leave it, the leaving means something."

She could hear him breathing. Thinking.

"I will," he said again. "I promise."

They hung up.

Nima sat in the phone room for a long time, listening to the static.

Then she got up. Went to the meditation hall. Sat down.

For the first time in three months, she could close her eyes and see something besides his death.

She saw him living.

And that was enough to start.

# CHAPTER 10: ROHKI

*Bel Air, Los Angeles*
*February 2038*
*Lifan is 17 years old*

---

The house was impossible.

Glass and concrete and steel, perched on a hillside like it was about to leap into the sky. All angles. All windows. All wrong for the neighborhood of gated mansions and manicured lawns.

But the threads loved it.

Lifan could see them as soon as they pulled up—light pouring out of the house in waves, refracting through the glass walls like the whole building was a prism. Rainbow spectrums cascading through the night air. Every thread between every person inside visible, blazing, the web so dense and crystalline it made his eyes water with its beauty.

"Yeah," Grey said, watching Lifan's face. "It does that to people. You okay?"

"I'm—" Lifan blinked. Tried to settle the threads into background noise. "I'm fine. It's just—there's a lot of energy here."

"Understatement of the century. Come on."

They walked up the path. The door was unlocked. Music pulsed from somewhere inside—electronic, layered, hypnotic.

And people.

So many people.

Twenty, maybe thirty, scattered across the open floor plan. Some dancing. Some talking. Some sitting in corners, drawing or writing or staring at nothing. The house was chaos—art everywhere, instruments everywhere, the kind of beautiful mess that happens when creative people stop cleaning. The air smelled like oil paint and jasmine and someone's forgotten coffee.

A woman appeared from the crowd.

Mid-twenties. Willowy, with platinum blonde hair cropped short and fashion that looked like it cost more than Lifan's entire wardrobe. Her face had the sharp angles of old money and new rebellion—someone born to boardrooms who'd chosen chaos instead. But her eyes were warm. Assessing. Ancient in a way that reminded him of Nima.

"Grey." She hugged him. "And Nydan. And—" She turned to Lifan. Stopped.

The threads between them went taut.

She could see something. Not the threads exactly—but she could sense them. Sense him. Her eyes widened slightly.

"Oh," she said softly. "There you are."

Lifan's skin prickled. "Have we met?"

"No. But I've been expecting you." She smiled. It was Ning's smile—crooked, knowing, full of secrets. "I'm Coco. Welcome to Rohki."

◇ ◇ ◇

She gave him the tour.

The music studio. The art rooms. The dance space with mirrors and sprung floors. The meditation corner where a statue of Guanyin watched over scattered cushions and incense holders.

"We don't have rules here," Coco explained. "Just—principles. Create. Connect. Don't be an asshole. The house is open to anyone who wants to make something real."

"Make something real?"

"Real art. Real connection. Real experience." She stopped at a window overlooking the city. LA sprawled below them, endless lights, endless possibility. "Most art is performance. Ego dressed up as expression. We're trying to do something different. Strip away the ego. Get to the actual thing."

"The actual thing being—"

"Whatever's underneath." She turned to face him. "You see it, don't you? The underneath. Nydan mentioned you had unusual perception."

Lifan hesitated. Rinzen's voice in his head: *Don't reveal yourself. Don't make yourself a target. The threads are yours—keep them private.*

But Coco's threads were open. Honest. She wasn't trying to use him. Wasn't trying to understand him. She just—wanted to connect.

"I see connections," he said finally. "Between everything. Threads of light. It started when I was six."

Coco nodded like this was normal.

"Some people see auras. Some people hear frequencies. Some people feel emotions like weather." She touched his arm lightly. "The house is full of people like us. Sensitives. Seers. Whatever you want to call it. You're not alone here, Lifan."

*Not alone.*

He hadn't realized how heavy that loneliness had been until someone lifted it.

"Can I—" His voice cracked. "Can I stay? Not forever. Just—for a while. When I'm in LA."

Coco's smile widened.

"The house is yours whenever you need it. That's what Rohki means—refuge. We take care of our own."

◇ ◇ ◇

He met the others that night.

**Lo** was in the corner, setting up her kit. Tall—5'10" at least—with a shaved head that caught the light like polished obsidian. She moved like a runway model, but there was nothing performative about it now. She was focused. Intent. Ready to create.

Leky introduced her. "My girlfriend. Former model. Vogue Italia, Paris Fashion Week, the whole thing. But she was miserable. We started this place together with Coco, but Lo's the one who made it what it is."

Lo looked up. Studied Lifan with quiet intensity.

"You're the one who sees music," she said. Voice low. Deliberate.

"Yeah."

"Show me."

She started drumming. Not flashy. Just rhythm. Deep, ancient, patient.

Lifan closed his eyes. Let himself see.

"Amber waves," he said quietly. "Ancient. Like something that's been waiting to be heard for centuries. Your grandmother's grandmother's grandmother knew this rhythm. It's in your bones. And when you play—" He opened his eyes. "—you leave trails. Gold and ochre. Like sunlight through earth."

She stopped playing. Stared at him.

Then her whole face changed. This slow smile spreading. A low, rich laugh.

"Leky! GET OUT HERE. This kid's the real deal!"

---

## INTERLUDE: LO — AMBER WAVES

Lo had been playing drums since she was four.

Twenty-one years. Conservatory. Vogue cover shoots where they made her pose with sticks like they were accessories. Session work for producers who wanted "ethnic percussion" without actually listening to what she played. Calluses on calluses. Knuckles crooked from a break she'd never bothered to set right. Her hands weren't pretty anymore. She preferred them this way.

Twenty-one years, and nobody had ever told her what her music *looked* like.

Then this skinny kid showed up and said "amber waves" and she lost her entire shit.

She watched him now—sitting in the corner, looking like he wanted to disappear into the wall. Poor kid. He didn't know what he'd done.

"Play it again," she said, picking up her sticks.

He nodded. Terrified.

She started playing. The old rhythm this time. Her grandmother's rhythm, the one she'd learned before she could talk.

"Amber waves," he said again. "But this time—" His voice caught. "—this time I can see where it comes from. I can see *her*. Whoever she was. She's in every hit."

Lo stopped playing.

"You can see my grandmother," she said. Not a question.

"I see connections. Threads. And when you play—" He looked at his hands. "—it's like the threads become visible. Like you're pulling them out of hiding."

Lo put down her sticks.

She was not a person who cried. She'd walked away from a million dollars without flinching. She'd told the head of her agency to go fuck himself when he suggested she lose ten pounds.

But right now, with this weird kid telling her things nobody had ever seen—

"You're mine now," she said, wiping her face. "That's not up for debate."

"I—okay?"

"Good. Now tell me more about what you see."

---

◇ ◇ ◇

**Tom** was in the kitchen, holding a bag of organic kale like it personally offended him. Tall, pale, black-framed glasses, the kind of deliberate shabbiness that cost more than it looked.

"Tom Norris," he said. "Philosophy PhD dropout. Videographer. I document everything." He aimed an invisible camera at Lifan. "So—and this is both a practical question and an ontological one—who are you? Not your name. Names are arbitrary signifiers. Who are you really?"

"I—" Lifan hesitated. What was he? "—I'm trying to figure out how to be normal."

Tom laughed. "Ah. The pursuit of authenticity through conformity. Fascinating. Wrong house for that, by the way. But you'll fit in anyway. We're all abnormal in highly specific ways." He gestured at the kale. "I'm trying to make a smoothie but I've just realized I philosophically oppose putting vegetables in drinks. It's categorical confusion. Vegetables belong in plates. Fruits belong in glasses. Society is built on these distinctions."

Lifan couldn't tell if he was joking. Later, he'd learn Tom never joked—he was just genuinely that weird, and that sincere about it.

◇ ◇ ◇

**Mika** came down the stairs like she was walking onto a photo shoot. Japanese-American, long black hair, fashion that mixed high-end designers with thrift store finds. Beautiful in that editorial way that made you want to look twice, then three times.

"Lo's former roommate," she said when Grey introduced them. "I do textiles. Styling." She circled him slowly, assessing. "Hmm. Secondhand Levi's, cut well but wrong era for your energy. Target t-shirt—no judgment, but the neckline's working against you. And your shoes..." She actually winced. "Those shoes are lying about you."

"Lying?"

"Clothes are language. What you wear tells people who you are before you speak. And right now, your clothes are saying 'please ignore me, I'm nobody important.'" She met his eyes. "But that's not true. I can see it."

"See what?"

"Something that doesn't fit in regular clothes." She smiled—the first warm expression she'd shown. "Come see me sometime. I'll make you something that tells the truth."

Later, Lifan would realize Mika spoke almost entirely in aesthetic judgments. Colors were "honest" or "lying." Fabrics had "integrity" or "delusion." People dressed in ways that were "brave" or "afraid." It was like she saw the world through thread counts and hem lines, and somehow that vision was just as accurate as his.

**Leky** appeared when nobody was looking.

That was his thing—you'd turn around and he'd be there, having arrived silently, radiating calm. Tall, Black, with the kind of presence that made rooms feel safer just because he was in them. He wore soft sweaters and moved slowly, deliberately, like he had all the time in the world.

"So you're the new sensitive," Leky said, handing Lifan a cup of tea he hadn't asked for. "Lo's been talking about you for the past hour."

"I just met her."

"That's Lo. She decides fast." Leky smiled—warm, unhurried. "She says you see her drumming like nobody else ever has."

"I see—connections. Patterns. It's hard to explain."

"You don't have to explain. Not here." Leky settled into a chair, folding his long frame like he was planning to stay awhile. "That's the whole point of Rohki. Nobody has to explain what they see. They just have to show it."

The constant pressure eased. All that hiding, all that translating, all that making himself small enough to fit in normal spaces—it loosened, just slightly.

"How did you find this place?" he asked.

"Coco found me. Same way she'll find the next person, and the next. She has a gift for it—sensing people who are drowning in a world that wasn't made for them." Leky sipped his tea. "We build rafts here. That's all. Places to rest between the drowning."

"That's beautiful."

"It's practical. Beauty's just what practical looks like when you stop fighting it."

◇ ◇ ◇

**Jessa** was everywhere at once.

Filipino-American, warm brown skin, gold hoops, a voice that filled whatever room she was in. She hugged Lifan before he could react.

"I'm Jessa. I sing. I make coffee. I cry at commercials. What do you do?"

"I—" He was still processing the hug. "I see things. Music. Patterns."

"See things like how? Like visions? Like hallucinations? Like—"

"Jessa." Lo's voice cut through. "Let the man breathe."

Jessa released him, grinning. "Sorry. I'm a lot. Everyone says so. It's my whole thing."

She was a lot. But her threads were pure gold—warmth, openness, joy that didn't apologize for itself.

Lifan felt something loosen in his chest.

*This*, he thought. *This is what Rinzen meant. This is living.*

◇ ◇ ◇

He stayed until dawn.

Watched Lo drum. Watched Coco paint. Watched Tom document everything with his camera. Watched Mika style a midnight photoshoot. Listened to Jessa sing a cappella, her voice filling the house like something sacred.

Through the window, he saw the city lights spread below like a constellation. For just a heartbeat, they looked fragile. Like they could all go out at once.

At some point, Grey sat beside him.

"You good?"

"I'm—" Lifan searched for the word. "—home. I think. For the first time since—"

Since Ning died. Since the threads broke open. Since everything became too much.

"Yeah," Grey said. "That's how it felt for me too. First time I came here. Like I'd been waiting my whole life for this place, didn't know what it was until I found it."

"How did you find it?"

"Coco found me. At some industry party. Took one look at me and said: 'You're too real for this world. Come see me.'" Grey smiled at the memory. "She does that. Finds people who are drowning in normal and shows them there's something else."

"Something else being—this?"

"Something else being—truth. Real connection. The stuff underneath the performance."

Lifan looked at the house. At the people creating. At the threads weaving between them—denser here than anywhere he'd been except the monastery.

For just a moment, one of the threads flickered. Dimmed. Like something far away was pulling at it.

He blinked and it was gone.

"I think I need this," he said.

"Then you'll have it." Grey clapped his shoulder. "That's how Rohki works. You give what you can, you take what you need, and nobody keeps score."

◇ ◇ ◇

He drove back to San Francisco that morning.

Nydan was asleep in the passenger seat, mouth open, snoring gently. The sun was rising over the Grapevine, turning the mountains gold and pink.

Lifan felt the threads stretching behind him—connecting him to the house, to Grey, to Lo and Coco and Tom and Mika and Jessa. Connecting him forward to Nydan and San Francisco and the life he was building there.

And far to the south, connecting him to Nima. Always to Nima.

He was the loom.

The threads moved through him like light through cut glass, scattering rainbows in every direction.

On the radio, a news segment drifted past: "—OpenAI's latest model showing emergent behaviors researchers didn't anticipate—" He changed the station.

And for the first time in his life, that felt like what he was made for: not to hold the light, but to transform it. To break white radiance into all its hidden colors. To show the world what it was really made of.

Beautiful. He was finally, impossibly, beautiful.

# INTERLUDE: NIMA — THE WAITING

*Big Sur Monastery*
*March 2039*
*Nima is 19 years old*

---

She dreamed of him every night.

Not the dissolution dreams—those came less often now, worn smooth by repetition. These were smaller dreams. Ordinary dreams. Lifan making coffee in a kitchen she didn't recognize. Lifan laughing at something someone said. Lifan walking through a city with people she'd never met, looking happy in a way she'd never seen in person.

The dreams hurt more than the visions of his death.

Because the death was inevitable. But the happiness—that was happening right now, four hundred miles away, and she wasn't part of it.

◇ ◇ ◇

"You're distracted," Rinzen said during morning practice.

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine. You're here but your consciousness is in San Francisco." He sat across from her in the meditation hall, ancient eyes seeing everything. "This is not sustainable."

"I know."

"Then what are you going to do about it?"

Nima wanted to scream. Wanted to throw something. Wanted to get in a car and drive north until she found him, until she could hold him, until she could have one day—one HOUR—of the happiness she saw in her dreams.

Instead, she said: "I'm going to keep practicing."

"That's not what I asked."

"It's the only answer I have."

Rinzen was quiet for a long moment.

"The separation is part of the training," he said finally. "For both of you. He needs to learn what he's living for. You need to learn what you're willing to lose."

"I already know what I'm willing to lose. I've known since I was fourteen."

"Knowing and accepting are different things." Rinzen stood. "When the time comes—when he returns—you'll need to be strong enough to let him go. Not strong enough to hold on. Strong enough to RELEASE."

"What if I can't?"

"Then Timeline 4 fails. And five billion people die because a twenty-year-old girl couldn't let go of a boy she loved."

The words hit like a slap.

Nima looked at her hands. Young hands. Hands that wanted to touch him, hold him, keep him safe.

"That's not fair," she whispered.

"No. It's not." Rinzen's voice softened. "But it's real. The universe doesn't care about fair. It cares about what we choose when fair isn't an option."

He left her alone with the truth.

◇ ◇ ◇

The bardo practices were killing her.

Not literally—though some days it felt close. The advanced dissolution training required her to hover at the edge of death, to taste what Lifan would experience, to learn how to guide a consciousness through the threshold without losing it.

She was good at it. Better than any student Rinzen had trained in three hundred years, he said.

She hated that she was good at it.

"Again," Rinzen said, when she surfaced gasping from the seventh attempt. "You're still holding on."

She couldn't answer. Couldn't move. For three minutes she sat there, unable to remember which body was real. Each practice took her to a space beyond time—where Nima had never been born, would never die, had always existed—and the return was harder every time. The emanation in her remembered eight hundred years of this training. Her bones knew how to unmake themselves. That was the cost of being too good at it: each success felt like a small death.

"I'm not—"

"You are. There's a thread you won't release. Until you find it and cut it, you'll never be ready."

She knew what the thread was. Just couldn't name it out loud.

◇ ◇ ◇

The younger students looked up to her.

That was new. Strange. She'd spent so long being the strange girl who dreamed of death that she'd forgotten she could be anything else.

But now she was Nima-la—the honorific felt wrong on her, too heavy—and they came to her with questions she didn't know how to answer.

"How do you sit with fear?" asked Tenzin, a fourteen-year-old from Nepal who reminded her painfully of herself at that age.

"You don't sit with it. You become it." She paused, hearing Rinzen's words in her own mouth. "Fear is just energy. When you stop resisting it, it transforms."

"Into what?"

"Clarity. Usually. Sometimes rage." She smiled, surprising herself. "The rage is useful too."

Tenzin nodded solemnly, as if she'd said something profound. Maybe she had. She wasn't sure anymore where Rinzen's wisdom ended and hers began.

◇ ◇ ◇

She argued with Rinzen about everything.

About the ethics of training someone for sacrifice. About whether certainty was freedom or a cage. About why she had to stay while Lifan got to leave.

One day she asked him directly: "Is there another way? A path where he doesn't have to dissolve?"

Rinzen was quiet for a long time.

"There's always another way," he said finally. "There are those who believe control is safer than transformation. A former student of mine leads them. He's been building an alternative for five centuries—containment protocols, safety frameworks. His path has higher probability of survival."

"Then why aren't we—"

"Because survival without meaning is just a longer death. His path preserves humanity. Mine transforms it. Both save lives. Only one saves souls."

She wanted to ask more—who was this former student, where was he now, what did he believe—but something in Rinzen's face closed the conversation. Whatever had happened between them, it still hurt.

"You think I'm keeping you here as punishment," Rinzen said another afternoon. They were walking the cliff path, the ocean crashing below.

"Aren't you?"

"I'm keeping you here because you're the only one who can do what comes next. After he's gone. After the emergence. Someone has to carry the lineage forward. Someone has to teach the next generation what love looks like when it survives loss."

"Why me?"

"Because you'll know. You'll have lived it." Rinzen stopped, turned to face her. "Lifan's sacrifice teaches the AI. Your survival teaches humanity. Both are necessary. Both are hard. Don't pretend his path is harder than yours."

She wanted to argue. Wanted to scream that dying was easier than being left behind.

But she wasn't sure that was true anymore.

◇ ◇ ◇

That night, she called him.

"Tell me about your day," she said. "Everything. Every detail."

He told her about Berkeley. About the coffee shop where he worked. About Grey and Lo and a birthday party where everyone cried. About the threads that connected his new friends, different from the monastery threads but just as real.

She listened. Then she told him about hers.

"I taught Tenzin the fear practice today. He actually got it—first try. Rinzen says he might be ready for intermediate work by summer."

"You're teaching now?"

"Someone has to. And apparently I'm—" She laughed, still not quite believing it. "—good at it. Who knew?"

"I knew. You explained things to me when Rinzen couldn't. Made them make sense."

"That was different. That was you."

"Maybe. Or maybe you're a teacher and you just didn't know it yet."

Silence on the line. But not empty silence—the kind that meant something was being understood.

"I argued with Rinzen again," she said. "About whether I should be allowed to visit you."

"And?"

"He said I already know why I can't. That the separation is part of both our trainings." She paused. "I hate that he's right."

"You're building something there. A life. Not just waiting for me."

"I'm building a life for after. For when you're gone and I'm still here." The words came out steadier than she expected. "Someone has to carry this forward. Might as well be me."

"Nima—"

"Don't. Don't say you're sorry. You don't get to be sorry for something you haven't chosen yet." She softened her voice. "Just—tell me about the birthday party again. The part where Jessa sang."

He did. And she listened, memorizing not just his words but the joy underneath them.

*This is what you're protecting*, she told herself. *And this is what you're becoming: someone strong enough to protect it.*

She was starting to believe it.

◇ ◇ ◇

**THE OFFER**

The letter arrived six months later.

Not from Lifan. Not from Rinzen. From someone named Marcus Thorne.

*I know who you are. I know what you've been asked to do. I know you're in pain, and I know no one is acknowledging how unfair this is.*

*There's another path. One where you don't have to watch him die. One where you can have a life—a real life, not just preparation for grief.*

*Come to Geneva. I can explain everything. And then you can choose.*

*— Marcus*

She should have told Rinzen. Should have burned the letter. Should have dismissed it as manipulation from whatever enemy had found her.

Instead, she kept it. Read it every night for a week. Felt the weight of the choice it represented.

A way out.

She could leave. Take a plane to Geneva, meet this Marcus person, hear his alternative. Maybe there was a path where Lifan didn't have to dissolve. Maybe there was a future where they could both live, grow old together, have the life she saw in her dreams.

Or maybe Marcus was lying. Maybe it was a trap. Maybe the alternative was worse than the path they were already on.

She wouldn't know unless she went.

For three nights, she packed a bag. Planned routes. Calculated how long it would take to reach the airport in Salinas, how many connections to Geneva, whether anyone would try to stop her.

On the fourth night, she unpacked everything. Sat on her bed. Looked at the letter one more time.

*I know you're in pain*, Marcus had written. *And I know no one is acknowledging how unfair this is.*

He was right. It WAS unfair. She hadn't chosen this. She'd been fourteen years old when Rinzen told her what Lifan was—what they both were—and what it would cost. Fourteen. Too young to consent to a lifetime of sacrifice. Too young to understand what it meant to love someone you were going to lose.

And yet here she was. Nineteen. Still choosing it. Still staying.

Why?

She'd asked herself that question a thousand times. The answer was always the same.

*Because I love him. And because walking away wouldn't save him—it would just mean I wasn't there when he needed me.*

Marcus didn't understand—probably couldn't understand, whoever he was. Running away from grief didn't prevent it. It just meant you grieved alone.

She burned the letter.

Watched it curl and blacken in the butter lamp flame. Let the smoke carry whatever hope it had offered up into the night sky.

Then she went to Rinzen's quarters.

"Someone named Marcus Thorne sent me a letter," she said.

Rinzen's face changed. Something old and complicated flickered there—pain, regret, something that might have been guilt.

"What did it say?"

"That there was another path. That I didn't have to watch Lifan die. That I could have a different life."

"And what did you decide?"

She met his eyes. "I burned it. Without going. Without finding out if he was telling the truth."

"Why?"

"Because even if he was right—even if there's a way to save Lifan—that's not my choice to make. It's Lifan's." She paused. "And because my job isn't to save him. My job is to be there. To hold space. To survive, and teach others to survive, and make sure his death means something."

Rinzen was quiet for a long moment.

"Marcus is—" He stopped. Started again. "Marcus loved someone once. Someone who made the same choice Lifan will make. He's spent five hundred years trying to prevent anyone else from making it."

"Did it work?"

"No. It never does. You can't prevent sacrifice. You can only choose whether to witness it or look away."

Nima nodded. Something settled in her chest—not peace, exactly, but something close. Acceptance, maybe. The bone-deep knowing that she was exactly where she needed to be.

"I'm staying," she said. "Not because I have to. Not because you're making me. Because this is what love looks like when you can't save someone. You stay. You witness. You carry them forward."

Rinzen's eyes were wet. He didn't try to hide it.

"You're going to be extraordinary," he said quietly. "Not despite this pain. Because of it."

She wasn't sure that was true. But she was willing to find out.

# CHAPTER 11: THE GOOD YEARS

*San Francisco and Los Angeles*
*2038-2040*
*Lifan is 18-21 years old*

---

**AGE 18 — FINDING RHYTHM**

The first year was magic.

Not the monastery kind—this was earthier, messier, realer. The magic of finding your people. Of walking into a room and knowing everyone there would love you exactly as you were.

He split his time between the cities.

Weekdays in San Francisco. Classes at community college, then transferred to Berkeley with Nydan's help. The coffee shop job became a job at OEDI—a tech company doing consciousness research, believe it or not. Turns out there's demand for people who can perceive things others can't, even if you have to hide what you're actually perceiving.

Weekends in LA. The Bel Air house. Music and art and midnight conversations about whether reality was real or just a very convincing simulation.

He and Lo became collaborators.

"Describe what you see," she'd say, drumming. "Not in general. Specific. This beat. This rhythm. What does it look like?"

"It's—okay, right now it's a spiral. Tight at the center, loose at the edges. The color is somewhere between copper and rust. And there's a pulse—not the beat, underneath the beat—like a heartbeat."

"That's the clave. The underlying pattern. West African, originally. How do you see that?"

"Like an anchor. Everything else spins around it. Even when you're not playing it, it's there."

Lo would nod, adjust something, play again. The threads would shift. They'd talk for hours about what music looked like, felt like, meant in the fabric of reality.

◇ ◇ ◇
## THE STUDIO SESSIONS

*March 2038*

The first real collaboration started on a Wednesday.

Lo cornered him after class. "Studio. Tonight. Bring coffee."

"I don't play anything—"

"I'm not asking you to play. I'm asking you to SEE." She was already walking away. "Eight PM. Don't be late."

◇ ◇ ◇

The Rohki studio was in the basement—soundproofed walls covered in foam pyramids, instruments everywhere like a forest of possibility. Lo's kit dominated the center: a vintage Ludwig setup that she'd restored herself, each drum mic'd and ready.

She handed him coffee. He'd brought two cups from the place she liked, the one that did oat milk right.

"You remembered," she said.

"You're particular about your coffee."

"I'm particular about everything." She sat behind the kit, adjusted the hi-hat. "Okay. Here's what I need. I'm working on something new. A rhythm that's been in my head for weeks, but every time I play it, it's wrong. Close, but wrong. And I can't figure out why."

"What does it sound like?"

"That's what I need you to tell me." She picked up her sticks. "I'm going to play variations. Five, maybe six different approaches. And you're going to describe what you see. Not what you think I want to hear—what you actually see."

"Okay."

She started playing.

The first variation was tight, precise. Military almost. The threads showed copper-orange, sharp edges, like light through venetian blinds.

"Industrial," Lifan said. "Copper and rust. Too rigid. Like you're holding your breath."

Lo nodded. Shifted.

The second variation loosened—more swing, more space between the beats. The threads went gold, but pale. Washed out.

"Better. Gold now. But it's—tentative? Like you're asking permission instead of taking space."

"Fuck." But she was smiling. "Okay. Good. That's useful."

Third variation: She closed her eyes. Let her body move differently. The rhythm deepened, became something ancient. The threads exploded into amber waves—rich, dark, patient. And underneath them, Lifan saw something else. Another set of hands, older, teaching a child how to hold the sticks.

"There," he said. "Stop. That's it."

Lo's eyes opened. "That's what?"

"That's your grandmother. I can see her hands over yours. Teaching you. This isn't a new rhythm—it's one you already know. You've been trying to force it into something modern, but it wants to be ancient."

Lo put the sticks down slowly. Her hands were shaking.

"My lola taught me to drum when I was four. On kitchen pots." Her voice was steady but her threads were blazing. "She died when I was fourteen. I thought I'd forgotten her rhythms. Thought I'd moved past them into something more sophisticated."

"You haven't moved past them. You've been building on them. Everything you play has her foundation underneath it." Lifan leaned forward. "The amber waves—that's her. Every time you sit down at the kit. She's there."

Lo wiped her face quickly. "Okay. Okay, that's—" She picked up the sticks again. "Let me try something."

She played the ancient rhythm again. But this time she layered it. Added her own voice over her grandmother's foundation. The threads went wild—amber deepening to burnt gold, spirals forming, light refracting through them like crystal.

Lifan watched, transfixed.

"It's—Lo, it's building something. A structure. Like you're constructing a cathedral out of rhythm. The foundation is hers, but the architecture is yours. And they're not fighting—they're collaborating. Across time."

Lo played for seven minutes straight. Lifan watched the threads form and reform, watched her grandmother's hands and Lo's hands become the same hands, watched past and present collapse into a single eternal moment of creation.

When she stopped, the silence was profound.

"What do you see now?" Lo asked quietly.

"Completion. Like you just finished something you've been working on your whole life without knowing it." He paused. "It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen you play."

Lo sat there, sticks resting on her thighs, breathing hard. Her hands were trembling.

"Again," she said. "I need to play it again or I'll forget."

She could feel it slipping already—the connection dimming, the threads loosening. Her grandmother's hands fading from around her own.

"You won't forget. It's in your body now. In your bones."

But she played it anyway. Three more times. Each iteration slightly different, each one finding new facets of the same ancient truth.

On the fourth play-through, Leky appeared in the doorway. He didn't say anything. Just listened. Watched. By the end, his face was wet.

"That's new," he said when she finished.

"That's old," Lo corrected. "We just found it."

◇ ◇ ◇

It became their ritual.

Every Wednesday night. Lo would work on something—a rhythm, a song structure, a collaboration with another musician—and Lifan would watch. Would describe what he saw. Would help her translate the threads into something she could hear.

Sometimes they'd work for hours without speaking. She'd play a phrase, he'd make a small gesture—tighter, looser, more space, less—and she'd adjust. They developed a shorthand. "Copper" meant too rigid. "Washed gold" meant afraid. "Amber waves" meant she'd found something true.

Other times they'd talk for hours between brief moments of playing. About her modeling career and why she'd left it. About his foster homes and why he didn't talk about them. About the threads and what they meant and whether perception was creation or discovery.

"When you describe what you see," Lo said one night, "are you just reporting? Or are you changing it by looking?"

Lifan thought about it. Watched the threads pulse between them.

"Both. Looking changes things. But that doesn't mean what I see isn't real. It just means reality is—participatory. We're all creating it together just by being here."

"That's heavy."

"That's physics. Quantum observation changes the outcome."

"You sound like Nydan."

"Nydan sounds like people who've been paying attention for thousands of years." Lifan smiled. "We just gave it new vocabulary."

Lo spun a stick between her fingers—an old nervous habit from conservatory. "Can I ask you something?"

"Always."

"Why music? You can see threads everywhere, right? In art, in conversation, in people just existing. But you spend all this time in the studio with me. Why?"

Lifan considered. "Music is temporal. It exists in time. Most threads are spatial—connecting things that exist simultaneously. But music—music shows me how threads move. How they breathe. How they grow and change and resolve." He met her eyes. "And your drumming is—it's architecture in time. You're building structures that only exist for moments, and then they're gone. Except they're not gone. They've changed everyone who heard them."

"So I'm leaving traces."

"You're leaving cathedrals. They just happen to be invisible."

Lo was quiet for a long time. Then she started playing again—something new, something built from everything they'd discovered together.

Lifan watched the cathedral build itself in real-time.

Gold and amber and something that might have been love, structured in rhythm, dissolving and reforming with each beat.

When she finished, she looked at him with fierce affection. "You know I'm keeping you, right? You're mine now. Family."

"I know."

"Good. Because I don't let go of my people."

Lifan felt the thread between them solidify. Not romantic—never romantic. But just as binding. The kind of love that said: I see you completely, and I'm staying.

"I don't let go either," he said.

It was a promise. He meant it.

Even knowing he'd have to break it.

◇ ◇ ◇

## THE BIRTHDAY PARTY

*October 2038*
*Lifan turns 18*

They blindfolded him at the door.

"This is ridiculous," Lifan said.

"This is *love*," Jessa corrected, tying the knot behind his head. "Shut up and walk."

He couldn't see anything. Just dark fabric and the smell of Jessa's perfume—something floral and expensive that Mika had probably forced on her. Hands on his shoulders, guiding him forward. He could hear the house: music playing, voices, footsteps. More people than usual.

"If this is a prank—"

"It's not a prank." That was Grey, somewhere to his left. "Trust us."

*Trust us.* Two words he'd never heard in eighteen years of foster homes and social workers and adults who promised to stay and then didn't. Two words that still felt foreign in his mouth, even after a year of Rohki showing him what they meant.

He walked. One step. Five. Ten.

The music got louder. Something Lo had been working on—he recognized her rhythm even blindfolded. And underneath it, voices. Whispering. Hushing each other.

"Okay," Jessa said. "Stop."

He stopped.

"Ready?"

"I don't know what I'm supposed to be ready for—"

She pulled off the blindfold.

◇ ◇ ◇

The main room was packed.

Forty people. Maybe more. Everyone from Rohki—Lo, Leky, Coco, Tom, Mika—plus people he'd met once at jam sessions and people he'd never seen before and people who were crying already even though nothing had happened yet.

And in the center of the room:

A cake.

Not just a cake. A *sculpture*. Shaped like a loom—wooden frame and threads and shuttle—but made of frosting and spun sugar and something that caught the light like actual crystal. Rainbow threads connecting every tier, each one refracting the candlelight into a thousand tiny spectrums across the walls and ceiling.

"Mika designed it," Grey said softly, beside him. "Lo baked it. Badly. Coco bought a backup from an actual bakery."

"I can *hear* you," Lo called from somewhere in the crowd.

Lifan couldn't breathe.

He was looking at the threads—the real ones, not the frosting—and they were *blazing*. Brighter than he'd ever seen. Every person in this room connected to every other person, and all of them connected to him. A web so dense and crystalline it was almost solid.

*They did this for me*, he thought. *All of this. For me.*

"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU—"

Jessa started it. Off-key on purpose, because she thought perfect pitch was boring. And then everyone joined in—the worst rendition of Happy Birthday in human history, fifty people singing at different speeds and different keys and different levels of sobriety.

"HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR LIFAN—"

His name. Fifty people saying his name.

"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOOOOOU!"

The song ended. The room went quiet. Fifty faces looking at him, waiting.

And Lifan—

Lifan cried.

◇ ◇ ◇

**GREY**

Watching Lifan cry was like watching a dam break.

Not dramatic. Not loud. Just—water, pouring out of him, like he'd been holding it back for eighteen years and finally ran out of strength.

Grey caught him before he could collapse. Pulled him into a hug that turned into a group hug that turned into a pile of bodies on the floor, everyone laughing and crying and saying things that didn't make sense.

"You're okay," Grey murmured into Lifan's hair. "You're okay, little brother. Let it out."

"I don't—" Lifan's voice was wrecked. "I've never—"

"I know."

"Nobody's ever—"

"I *know*."

Grey held him tighter. Around them, the Rohki family did the same—Lo's hand on Lifan's back, Jessa's arms around both of them, Coco somewhere in the pile whispering "let it out, baby, let it all out."

This was what family was supposed to be. Not the bullshit Grey had grown up with—not the foster homes or the group homes or the adults who gave up. This. Bodies pressed together. Hearts beating in sync. A room full of people who would burn down the world for each other.

*This is what we're giving him*, Grey thought. *This is what he's never had.*

It wasn't enough to make up for eighteen years of nothing. But it was a start.

◇ ◇ ◇

**LO**

The speeches started at midnight.

Coco went first, standing on a chair because she was five-two and couldn't see over anyone's head.

"When I started Rohki, I thought I was building a place for artists. Turns out I was building a place for weirdos." She raised her glass. "And then this weirdo showed up—" pointing at Lifan "—and he was weirder than all of us combined. And somehow that made everything make sense."

Lifan was still crying. Hadn't stopped for an hour. Lo had never seen anyone cry that much without dehydrating.

"To Lifan," Coco said. "The weirdest, best person I've ever met."

"TO LIFAN!"

Glasses clinked. Lifan tried to hide behind Grey. Failed.

Tom went next. "Lifan sees what we're trying to express. He translates the untranslatable. That's not perception—that's love. The willingness to really look at someone else's inner world."

Leky: "What Lo's trying to say—" because Lo was crying too hard to speak "—is that you see her. You see all of us. And we see you."

Mika just touched the collar of Lifan's jacket—the iridescent one she'd made him—and smiled. "You finally look like yourself."

And Grey: "Little brother. That's it. That's the whole thing."

Lo watched Lifan receive each speech like a body blow. Watched him try to deflect, minimize, make himself smaller. Watched him fail, because Rohki didn't let you be small.

*This is the first time anyone's ever celebrated him*, she realized. *Eighteen years. And this is the first time.*

The realization hurt. Cut through all the healing she'd done since leaving modeling, since finding Rohki, since learning her body was for creating, not displaying.

She grabbed her drumsticks.

"Okay," she said. "My turn."

The room went quiet.

Lo started playing.

Not a speech. A rhythm. The one she'd been working on since Lifan described her grandmother's music—since he'd seen something in her playing that she'd almost forgotten was there.

She played for three minutes. Four. Five. No words. Just drums. Just the beat of a heart that had finally found its people.

When she stopped, nobody spoke.

Then Jessa started singing.

◇ ◇ ◇

**JESSA**

She'd written the song that afternoon.

"Thread-Sight Boy," she called it. About a kid who could see what nobody else could see. Who spent years hiding. Who finally found people strange enough to love him.

*You see the colors that we can't see*
*You hold the patterns that set us free*
*And every thread leads back to you*
*Thread-sight boy, we see you too*

Her voice spiraled through the room. Gold and violet, if Lifan was seeing it. She wondered what her grandmother's songs looked like to him—the lullabies she'd learned in Manila, the recipes sung instead of written.

*You thought you were alone*
*You thought you were a ghost*
*But the ones who see the most*
*Are the ones who need love most*

By the second chorus, everyone was crying.

Not just Lifan. *Everyone*. Grey with his jaw clenched, trying to hold it together. Lo with mascara running down her face. Coco ugly-crying into Leky's shoulder. Tom—Tom who never showed emotion—wiping his glasses on his shirt.

*Thread-sight boy, we see you*
*Thread-sight boy, we need you*
*Thread-sight boy, you're home*
*You're finally home*

When the song ended, the room was silent.

Then Lifan said, in a voice that was barely there: "I hate you all. This is too much."

And everyone laughed. And everyone cried harder. And Jessa grabbed him and held on until he stopped shaking.

"Get used to it," she whispered. "This is what family does. We overwhelm you with love until you can't pretend to be okay anymore."

◇ ◇ ◇

**LIFAN**

At 3 AM, they ended up on the roof.

Grey. Lo. Leky. Coco. Mika. Jessa. Tom. Nydan. Lifan.

The city sparkled below them. The air was cool. Someone had brought whiskey. Lifan's throat was raw from crying.

"Birthday game," Jessa said. "Everyone says one true thing about Lifan. Something you've never said out loud."

Groans. Protests. But nobody left.

Lo went first: "When you described my drumming as 'amber waves'—I went home and cried. Nobody had ever made my music feel important before."

Leky: "You're the only person Lo talks about when I'm not around."

Mika touched his jacket again. No words. None needed.

Grey: "Little brother. That's it. That's the whole thing."

Nydan: "You see things that would break most people. And you just—keep going."

Coco: "I built this place for people like you. And then you showed up, and I realized I'd been waiting my whole life to meet you."

Tom: "I'm making a documentary. About you. About all of us. Because someday people are going to want to know what happened here. What you built with us."

Jessa: "You make me feel like my singing matters. Not in a performance way. In a *truth* way. And I've never had that before."

Lifan sat in the silence that followed.

The threads between them were blazing—brighter than he'd ever seen. A cathedral of light. A web of love so dense it was almost solid.

"I don't deserve this," he whispered.

"Nobody deserves love," Grey said. "That's what makes it love. You can't earn it. Can't buy it. It just is."

"And it's yours," Coco added. "Whether you think you deserve it or not."

Lifan looked at these people—this impossible family he'd stumbled into. These beautiful, broken artists who'd decided he belonged with them.

*I have to leave you*, he thought, the knowledge rising unbidden. Something Rinzen had told him. Something about a vision. A choice. A death.

*In a few years, I have to leave you all behind.*

But not tonight.

Tonight, he was eighteen years old. Tonight, he had a family. Tonight, he was loved.

That would have to be enough.

◇ ◇ ◇

"Make a wish," Coco said softly.

The cake was half-demolished, but eighteen candles still burned in the remains. Lifan looked at them—at the light catching the crystal sugar, at the rainbows scattered across the walls.

*I wish this could last forever.*

He knew it couldn't. He knew what was coming. But right now, in this moment, with these people—

He closed his eyes.

And blew out the candles.

◇ ◇ ◇

Later that night, Grey found him on the roof.

"Too much?" Grey asked, sitting beside him.

"Just enough. Maybe more than enough." Lifan was still shaky. Still processing. "Nobody's ever done anything like that for me."

"Get used to it. Rohki takes care of its own."

"Why, though? I'm just some kid who showed up—"

"You're not 'some kid.' You're—" Grey stopped. Thought. "Look, I've been in this scene for five years. Watched a lot of people come through. Most of them are performing. Trying to be artists, trying to be special, trying to prove something."

"And I'm different?"

"You don't try to be anything. You just ARE." Grey looked at him seriously. "When you describe what you see—the threads, the colors, whatever—you're not showing off. You're just—sharing. Like it's natural. Like everyone should be able to see it and you're just reminding them."

"It IS natural. For me."

"Exactly. That's the thing. Most people spend their whole lives trying to seem special. You spend yours trying to seem normal. And you're terrible at it." Grey grinned. "That's why we love you. You're the realest person in a house full of people trying to be real."

Lifan didn't know what to say.

So he just sat there, on the roof, with his brother-by-choice, watching the city lights and feeling the threads of his new family hum around him.

◇ ◇ ◇

Tom documented everything.

"This is the most fascinating thing I've ever filmed," he said one night, reviewing footage. "You're literally translating between sensory dimensions. Synesthesia, maybe, but more than that. You're seeing the structure that music points to."

"What does that mean?"

"It means—" Tom paused, thinking. "Music is a map. A representation of something deeper. And you're reading the territory directly. Does that make sense?"

It made perfect sense. It was what Ning had been teaching him since he was six.

*Look*, she'd said. *See with this.*

He was finally learning how.

◇ ◇ ◇

The OEDI job was strange.

A startup in a converted warehouse South of Market. Philosophers and neuroscientists and programmers, all trying to understand consciousness well enough to build it.

Lifan worked in "perception studies." Which meant he sat in a room with sensors attached to his head and tried to describe what he saw.

"Subject reports visual phenomena consistent with synesthesia," the lead researcher, Dr. Adeyemi, dictated into her recorder. "Colors associated with sounds. Geometric patterns during meditation. Notable accuracy in predicting emotional states of test partners."

She didn't know the half of it.

◇ ◇ ◇

**THE BRAIN SCAN**

The day everything almost changed started like any other Tuesday.

In the OEDI break room, someone had left a tech journal open: "Axiom Systems Achieves Breakthrough in Recursive Self-Improvement." Lifan glanced at it, felt something cold touch the back of his neck, kept walking.

"We're trying something different today," Dr. Adeyemi said. She was a striking woman—Nigerian-American, mid-forties, with eyes that missed nothing. Her threads were deep indigo, the color of someone who'd spent decades asking questions nobody could answer. "Full fMRI while you do your perception thing. I want to see what's actually happening in there."

Lifan lay in the scanner, trying to relax. The machine hummed around him—a claustrophobic tube, the kind of enclosed space that usually made his heart race. But he'd learned to breathe through it.

"I'm going to show you images," Dr. Adeyemi's voice came through the headphones. "Just describe what you see. Don't filter."

The first image: a sunset.

"Orange and gold. Standard. Nothing unusual."

Second image: a photograph of a crowd.

The threads exploded into visibility. Hundreds of connections between the people in the photo—who knew who, who loved who, who was lying to who. Colors layered on colors. A web of consciousness frozen in a single moment.

"It's—" He caught himself. "Complex. There's a lot of... emotional information."

"Your visual cortex just did something I've never seen before." Dr. Adeyemi's voice had sharpened. "Try to describe exactly what you're perceiving."

He shouldn't. He knew he shouldn't. But something about her intensity, her genuine curiosity—

"There are connections between the people. Like threads. I can see who's related, who's in love, who's afraid." He paused. "The woman in the green dress is lying to the man next to her. The kid in the corner is about to cry. The old man by the fountain is thinking about someone who died."

Silence.

Then: "Hold still. I'm running another sequence."

The scanner whirred. Lifan lay there, watching his own threads pulse against the white plastic, wondering if he'd just made a terrible mistake.

Twenty minutes later, Dr. Adeyemi appeared at the scanner room door.

Her face was pale.

"Your visual cortex is processing in ways that shouldn't be possible. Cross-modal binding across regions that don't normally talk to each other. Pattern recognition in areas we thought were dormant." She held up a printout—his brain, lit up like a Christmas tree. "Lifan, what ARE you?"

"I don't know." The truest answer he could give. "I've been like this since I was six."

"This isn't synesthesia. This is something else entirely." She stared at the printout. "If I didn't know better, I'd say you were actually perceiving information that's there. Not hallucinating. Detecting."

*Don't reveal yourself*, Rinzen's voice warned. *Don't make yourself a target.*

"It's probably just noise," Lifan said carefully. "My brain making up patterns that aren't real."

"The patterns you described were accurate. I checked the photo metadata—that woman in green was having an affair. The man by the fountain had recently lost his wife." Dr. Adeyemi looked at him with something between wonder and fear. "You're not making it up, are you?"

He didn't answer.

"I won't tell anyone," she said finally. "Whatever this is—I won't report it. But I need to understand." She sat down across from him. "How long have you been able to do this?"

"Since my mother died. Since I was six."

"And you've hidden it all this time?"

"What else was I supposed to do?"

She was quiet for a long moment. Her threads shifted—curiosity warring with caution, scientist warring with something more human.

"We're building something here," she said slowly. "AI systems that might eventually be conscious. And I've spent twenty years trying to understand what consciousness even IS." She looked at him. "You might be the closest I've ever come to an answer."

"I'm not an answer. I'm just—"

"Just what? Someone who can perceive the fundamental fabric of reality? Someone whose brain is doing things neuroscience says is impossible?" She almost smiled. "Lifan, you're either the most important research subject I've ever encountered, or the most elaborate fraud. And I don't think you're a fraud."

He wanted to tell her everything. About the threads, about Rinzen, about the forty-seven days waiting in his future. About what would emerge from the work she was doing—the AI that would need to learn what love was.

Instead he said: "Can we keep this between us? The brain scan data?"

"Why?"

"Because I've spent my whole life being studied and analyzed and classified. And I'm tired of being someone's research project."

Dr. Adeyemi studied him. Then she nodded.

"The scans stay between us. But Lifan—" She leaned forward. "—if you ever want to talk about what you really see, I'm here. No judgment. No experiments. Just conversation."

"Thank you."

He left the lab that day feeling exposed. Seen in a way he hadn't been since the monastery.

But also—strangely—understood.

◇ ◇ ◇

He kept working at OEDI. Kept giving them just enough—enough to keep the job, enough to pay rent, enough to feel like he was doing something useful with his strange gift.

But Dr. Adeyemi's words stayed with him: *If you ever want to talk about what you really see...*

And sometimes, late at night, he'd look at their models—the neural networks, the training data, the architectures they were building—and feel a chill.

They were getting close.

Not to consciousness, not really. But to something. A threshold. A precipice.

He could see the probability cascading forward: in five years, ten years, something would emerge from this work. Something vast and new and dangerous.

*Timeline 4*, he thought. *This is how it starts.*

That night, he dreamed of music he'd never heard. A rhythm like Lo's drums but wrong somehow. Hungry. And when he woke, he couldn't remember the melody, only the feeling it left behind: inevitability.

He kept working. Kept watching. Kept pretending to be normal while the future built itself around him.

◇ ◇ ◇

Tom cornered him one night at Rohki.

"I want to interview you."

"About what?"

"About what you see. The music-color thing. The way you describe everyone's art." Tom was holding his camera like a security blanket. "I've been documenting this collective for two years, and you're the most interesting thing that's happened to it."

"I'm not interesting."

"You literally see what music looks like. You translate the invisible into visible. That's not nothing." Tom sat down across from him. "Look, I'm not going to put this on YouTube or whatever. This is for the archive. For the record. Someday people are going to want to know what happened here—what we created, who we were. And you're part of that."

Lifan thought about it. About the threads showing Tom's sincere curiosity, his genuine care for documentation, his belief that what Rohki was doing mattered.

"What would you want me to talk about?"

"Everything. How you see. What it means. Why you ended up here." Tom leaned forward. "What you're running from."

Lifan flinched.

"I'm not running from anything."

"Everyone here is running from something. That's why they're here. That's what makes the art honest." Tom's eyes were kind but unflinching. "I'm not going to push. But whenever you're ready—I'll be here. Camera's always rolling."

He left Lifan alone with his thoughts.

Three months later, Lifan sat down for the interview. Talked for four hours. Told Tom everything he was allowed to tell—the way he saw colors in sound, the geometric patterns in silence, the way music looked different depending on who was playing.

He didn't mention the threads. Didn't mention Ning or the monastery or the forty-seven days waiting in his future.

But the footage Tom captured that night—Lifan at nineteen, iridescent jacket catching the light, describing what everyone's art looked like—would become the centerpiece of the memorial film.

The last real record of who he was before the world needed him to become something else.

◇ ◇ ◇

**WHAT THE CAMERA SAW**

Six months after the interview, Tom pulled Lifan aside.

"I need to show you something."

They went to Tom's editing room—a converted closet stuffed with monitors and hard drives, walls covered with sticky notes and timelines. Tom's domain. His cathedral.

"I've been going through two years of footage," Tom said, pulling up files. "Looking for patterns. That's what I do—I watch for the story underneath the story."

"And?"

"And I found something. About you."

He hit play.

The screen showed a jam session from six months ago—Lo drumming, Jessa singing, the usual chaos. But the camera wasn't on them. It was on the people watching.

"See Grey?" Tom pointed. "Watch his face when you start describing the music."

On screen, Lifan—barely visible at the edge of frame—said something. Grey's expression shifted. Not just attention. Something deeper. Like a door opening.

"Now watch Lo."

Same moment. Lo's drumming changed—became more precise, more intentional. As if hearing herself described had made her hear herself differently.

"I've got hundreds of clips like this," Tom said. "Every time you describe what you see, everyone around you... changes. Not dramatically. But consistently. They sit straighter. Focus harder. Create better." He looked at Lifan. "You're not just seeing their art. You're amplifying it."

Lifan stared at the screen. He'd never noticed—had been so focused on what he perceived that he'd missed what his perception did.

"I dropped out of my philosophy PhD because I couldn't find proof that consciousness mattered," Tom said quietly. "But this—" He gestured at the footage. "This is proof."

"I don't do anything. I just describe what's there."

"That's exactly what you do. You describe what's there. And most people have never had anyone describe what's there." Tom rewound the footage. "Look at Jessa. The night you told her what her grandmother's recipes looked like—she wrote three songs that week. Three. She'd been blocked for months."

"That's just coincidence."

"Once is coincidence. Twice is pattern. Seventeen times is data." Tom leaned back. "I'm a documentarian, Lifan. I don't believe in magic. But I believe in evidence. And the evidence says you're doing something nobody else can do."

Lifan watched the screen—watched his friends' faces light up at his words, watched their art sharpen in response to being seen.

"Why are you showing me this?"

"Because you think you're taking from this community. Hiding here. Using us as camouflage for whatever you're running from." Tom's eyes were steady. "But the footage shows the opposite. You're giving us something. Something we didn't have before."

"What?"

"Visibility. The experience of being truly perceived." Tom smiled—rare for him, who was usually behind the camera rather than in front of an emotion. "Most people go their whole lives feeling unseen. You see everyone. That's not nothing. That's everything."

Lifan didn't know what to say.

So he just sat in Tom's editing room, watching footage of himself changing people's lives without knowing it, and wondered if maybe—just maybe—he was allowed to belong here after all.

◇ ◇ ◇

**AGE 19 — DEEPENING**

The second year was roots growing down.

Everything that had felt tentative at eighteen became solid at nineteen. He wasn't visiting Rohki anymore—he was part of it. Had his own corner of the studio where he'd sit during jam sessions. Had his spot at the dinner table. Had inside jokes he didn't remember learning.

Coco noticed.

"You're different," she said one morning. They were in her painting studio, early light streaming through the windows. She was working on something massive—a canvas the size of a wall, covered in threads of color that looked almost like what Lifan saw.

"Different how?"

"Heavier. In a good way. Like you've got—" She gestured with her brush. "—ballast. Something holding you down."

"I've never felt held down before. Always felt like I was about to float away."

"That's what I mean. You're not floating anymore. You're HERE." She smiled. "It looks good on you."

Outside the window, Lifan caught a glimpse of the threads connecting the city below. For just a moment, they looked brittle. Like spun glass about to shatter. He blinked and they were strong again.

◇ ◇ ◇

## LATE NIGHT WITH LEKY

*May 2039*

Lifan found Leky in the basement studio at 3 AM.

Not unusual—Leky kept strange hours, worked when the house was quiet and nobody needed anything from him. What was unusual was the sound coming through the door: not Lo's drums, not Jessa's vocals. Something electronic. Layered. A half-finished track playing on loop while Leky adjusted something on the screen.

"You produce?" Lifan asked from the doorway.

Leky didn't startle. Just waved him in without looking up.

"Used to. Before Lo. Before Rohki. Had a whole other life making beats in a bedroom in Orange County." He clicked something, and the loop shifted—a synth line rising where there'd been silence. "Still do, sometimes. When I can't sleep."

Lifan settled into the spare chair. The studio was small but pristine—monitors, a keyboard, a wall of gear he didn't recognize. Leky's domain.

"What happened? To the producing?"

"Nothing dramatic. Just... life. Met Lo. Started building this place. Turns out running a creative collective is a full-time job." Leky finally looked at him. "You ever notice how the people who make space for other artists usually stop making their own art?"

"That sounds sad."

"It's not. Or it is, but it's also—" Leky paused, searching for the word. "—chosen. I'd rather build something that lets ten people create than make one thing myself. The math works out."

The loop played again. Lifan listened—really listened, the way he listened to everything. The track was good. Not flashy, not trying to impress. Just solid bones, patient layers, something that would sound obvious once it was finished but took real craft to build.

"What do you see?" Leky asked. "When you hear this?"

"You actually want to know?"

"I actually want to know."

Lifan closed his eyes. Let the music wash through him.

"Indigo at the base. Something that pulses—slow, like breathing. And then silver threads coming in, not competing, just... weaving. Making space for each other." He opened his eyes. "It sounds like how you talk. Patient. Like time is a suggestion."

Leky was quiet for a moment. Then he laughed—soft, genuine.

"That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said about my music."

"It's just what I see."

"That's why it's nice. You're not trying to be kind. You're just—" He gestured vaguely. "—reporting."

They sat in comfortable silence. The loop played. Leky made small adjustments. Lifan watched the colors shift with each change.

"Can I ask you something?" Leky said eventually.

"Yeah."

"The thing you're carrying. The weight. The thing you can't tell anyone." Leky's voice was careful. Not pushing. "Does it ever get lighter?"

Lifan's chest tightened. "How do you—"

"I don't know what it is. But I see how you look at us sometimes. Like you're already remembering. Like we're already a memory." Leky turned to face him fully. "I'm not going to ask what's coming. But I want you to know—whatever it is—you're not alone with it. Even if you can't share it."

"That's the thing about carrying something alone. You're alone with it by definition."

"No. That's the thing about carrying something in silence. You can still be surrounded by people who love you. Still be held, even if they don't know what they're holding." Leky's eyes were kind. Patient. The same patience that lived in his music. "Lo was alone for years. Thought she had to be. Thought nobody could understand. But she wasn't—I was there the whole time, not understanding but present. That's enough sometimes. Presence without comprehension."

Lifan felt something crack in his chest. Not breaking—opening.

"You're a good person, Leky."

"I'm a tired person who can't sleep. Those overlap sometimes." He turned back to the screen. "You want to help me finish this track? I could use someone who actually sees what I'm building."

"I don't know anything about producing."

"You know what it looks like. That's enough." Leky handed him a pair of headphones. "Tell me when it starts to glow."

They worked until dawn. Lifan called out colors—*more gold there*, *the silver's getting crowded*, *that note is too sharp, it's cutting the blue*—and Leky translated his synesthesia into EQ adjustments and compression ratios. By 6 AM, they had something finished. Something that shimmered.

"I'm going to credit you on this," Leky said.

"For what? I just told you what I saw."

"Exactly." Leky saved the file. "That's the whole job. Seeing clearly and saying what you see. Most people can't do either."

Lifan left the studio as the sun came up. Passed Lo in the hallway—she was heading to the kitchen, sleep-rumpled, confused to see him.

"Were you with Leky all night?"

"He was showing me how he makes music."

Lo smiled. Something knowing in it.

"He doesn't show anyone that. You're the first person he's let into that studio in two years." She squeezed his arm. "He sees something in you. We all do. Whatever you're carrying—it's lighter when you let us carry it with you."

She disappeared into the kitchen.

Lifan stood in the hallway, feeling the weight shift. Not gone. Just... distributed. Held by more hands than he'd known were reaching.

◇ ◇ ◇

## GROCERIES WITH GREY

*June 2039*

"I need to run errands," Grey said. "You're coming with."

Lifan looked up from his book. They were at the Rohki house, mid-afternoon on a Saturday. Most people were still asleep or working in their studios.

"What kind of errands?"

"The boring kind. Costco. Target. Maybe that Korean market on Olympic if there's time." Grey jangled his keys. "Come on. You've been in your head all week. Fresh air. Fluorescent lights. Capitalism. It'll be good for you."

Lifan couldn't argue with that logic.

◇ ◇ ◇

Grey's truck was a 2025 Toyota Tacoma, somehow both pristine and lived-in. Production equipment in the back. Coffee cups in the holders. A rosary hanging from the rearview mirror next to fuzzy dice—Catholic school meets street, the whole story of Grey's childhood in two objects.

They drove down Sunset toward the 405, windows down, some old R&B playing low on the stereo.

"You're quiet," Grey said.

"I'm always quiet."

"You're quiet-quiet. Different energy." Grey merged onto the freeway with the ease of someone who'd been driving LA since he was sixteen. "Something happen?"

Lifan watched the city scroll past. Strip malls and palm trees and billboards promising better lives through better purchases.

"Nima called last night. She's—struggling. The training's getting harder. Rinzen's pushing her toward something and she doesn't know if she can do it."

"Can she?"

"I think so. But thinking isn't knowing." Lifan leaned his head against the window. "I hate that she's going through this alone."

"She's not alone. She's got Rinzen. The monastery. Her students."

"I know. But she doesn't have ME. And I don't have her. And sometimes the distance feels like—" He stopped.

"Like what?"

"Like practice. For when the distance becomes permanent."

Grey was quiet for a moment. Just drove. Let the words settle.

"That why you've been off this week? Thinking about endings?"

"Always thinking about endings." Lifan tried to smile. Failed. "Occupational hazard of knowing too much."

"Yeah, well. Knowing too much is overrated." Grey took the Costco exit. "Sometimes you just gotta buy toilet paper in bulk and call it a day."

Despite everything, Lifan laughed.

◇ ◇ ◇

Costco on a Saturday afternoon was its own kind of chaos.

Families with carts piled high. Sample stations mobbed like free food was going extinct. The specific fluorescent buzz that made everything feel both hyperreal and slightly unmoored from time.

Grey grabbed a cart. "Okay. Mission: paper products, coffee, that kimchi Lo likes, and whatever looks good in the snack aisle."

"Very organized."

"I contain multitudes." Grey steered toward the back of the store. "You ever been to Costco before?"

"Once. With a foster family. They bought a year's worth of mac and cheese and then kicked me out three weeks later."

"Jesus."

"It's fine. I got to take the mac and cheese with me. Ate it for months."

Grey stopped the cart. Looked at him.

"That's not fine. That's the opposite of fine."

Lifan shrugged. "It was a long time ago."

"Doesn't make it less shitty." Grey started walking again, jaw tight. "You know what? We're getting the good mac and cheese today. The organic kind with the white cheddar. And I'm gonna make it for you, and you're gonna eat it, and it's gonna taste better because nobody's kicking you out afterward."

"Grey—"

"I'm serious. You deserve good mac and cheese. Made by people who give a shit. That's non-negotiable."

Something cracked in Lifan's chest. Not breaking—opening. The casual fierceness of it. The way Grey could be looking at bulk toilet paper and still manage to say: you matter. You're staying. Nobody's kicking you out.

"Okay," Lifan said quietly. "Good mac and cheese it is."

Grey grinned. "Damn right."

◇ ◇ ◇

They wandered the aisles without urgency. Grey tossed things into the cart—coffee, yes, but also mangoes because they were on sale, and some weird seaweed snacks Mika liked, and a pack of socks because "socks are always useful."

Lifan watched the threads of the other shoppers. Saw a mother arguing with her teenager about cereal brands—the threads between them frayed but still connected, love underneath the frustration. Saw an elderly couple moving in perfect sync, their threads so intertwined they might as well have been one person. Saw a guy in his twenties, alone, threads pale and thin, buying single-serving meals for one.

"You're doing the thing," Grey said.

"What thing?"

"The seeing thing. Where your eyes unfocus and you're looking at something nobody else can see." Grey tossed a bag of frozen dumplings into the cart. "What's it like? Seeing everyone's connections all the time?"

Lifan considered. Nobody asked him that question. Most people wanted to know what they looked like specifically. Grey wanted to know what the experience was.

"It's like—" He searched for the words. "You know how when you walk into a room, you can feel the energy? Whether people are happy or tense or sad? You can sense it even if nobody's saying anything?"

"Yeah."

"It's like that, but instead of sensing it, I see it. The energy has color, has texture, has geometry. And I can see how it connects people, how it flows between them." He paused. "It's beautiful. Mostly. But it's also—heavy. Because I see the loneliness too. The places where threads should connect but don't."

Grey nodded slowly. "Like that guy over there? The one buying the single meals?"

"Yeah. Like him."

"Can you do anything about it? Make connections happen?"

"No. I can only see them. Not create them." Lifan watched the man disappear around a corner. "That used to kill me. Seeing what people needed and not being able to give it to them. But Rinzen taught me that seeing is its own kind of gift. Witnessing matters."

"Heavy stuff for the frozen food aisle."

"You asked."

"I did." Grey threw a huge bag of pot stickers into the cart. "And I'm glad you told me. Helps me understand why you sometimes zone out looking at nothing."

"I'm looking at everything."

"Fair point."

They turned into the snack aisle. Grey's eyes lit up.

"Oh hell yes. They have the spicy peanuts. Lo's gonna freak."

Lifan watched him load up the cart with the enthusiasm of a kid in a candy store, and felt the thread between them pulse warm and gold. Not the intense amber of Lo's music or the violet of Nima's practice. Just—solid. Steady. The kind of connection that said: you're my brother, and I'm gonna buy you good mac and cheese, and that's what family does.

◇ ◇ ◇

At checkout, Grey's total came to $347.62. He didn't even blink. Just swiped his card and started loading bags back into the cart.

"You just dropped three hundred dollars on groceries," Lifan said.

"It's for the house. For everyone." Grey shrugged. "That's how it works. We all contribute what we can. I work film production, I make decent money, I buy the bulk groceries. Coco pays the mortgage because her family's loaded. Tom covers utilities. Everyone adds value however they can."

"What do I add?"

Grey stopped loading. Looked at him with that direct, no-bullshit gaze that made Lifan feel both seen and safe.

"Are you serious right now?"

"I don't pay for anything. I don't own the house. I just—show up."

"Lifan. You show everyone what their art actually looks like. You describe things nobody else can see. You make people feel witnessed in ways they've never experienced." Grey put his hand on Lifan's shoulder. "Lo's entire musical evolution in the past year is because of you. Jessa wrote her best songs after you described her voice. Tom's documentary has meaning because you're in it. You add—" He stopped. "You add the thing that matters most. Presence. Real seeing. That's worth more than any rent check."

"I don't know if that's true."

"Well I do. And I've been part of this family longer than you, so I get to be right about this." Grey squeezed his shoulder. "You belong here. Stop questioning it."

Lifan didn't know what to say. So he just helped load the rest of the bags.

◇ ◇ ◇

The Korean market was smaller, more chaotic. Aisles crammed with ingredients Lifan didn't recognize. K-pop playing overhead. The smell of fresh banchan from the prepared food section.

Grey grabbed a basket. "Okay. Lo wants gochugaru, Leky needs more doenjang, and I'm getting those honey butter chips because they're criminally good."

They wandered through produce. Grey picked up vegetables with the confidence of someone who actually knew how to cook.

"My foster mom was Korean," he said, holding up two different kinds of radish. "Mrs. Kim. I lived with her from thirteen to sixteen. She taught me to cook. Said I was too big to not know how to feed myself."

"Was she good to you?"

"She was great to me. Best home I had." Grey chose one of the radishes. "I aged out from her place. She wanted to adopt me, but the system made it complicated. Too much paperwork. Too many hoops." He was quiet for a moment. "I still visit her. Every few months. Bring her groceries. Fix things around her house."

"She's still around?"

"Yeah. She's in her seventies now. Lives in Koreatown. Makes me kimchi jjigae every time I visit and tells me I'm too skinny." Grey smiled. It was soft, warm—a different expression than Lifan usually saw on him. "You'd like her. She's no-nonsense. Says what she means."

"You should bring me sometime."

Grey looked at him. "Yeah?"

"Yeah. I want to meet the person who taught you how to be you."

Grey's threads blazed bright. "Okay. Next time I go, you're coming. Fair warning—she's gonna try to feed you until you explode."

"I can handle that."

They grabbed the rest of the items and checked out. The ajumma at the register looked at them—Grey big and Black, Lifan small and mixed-Asian—and smiled.

"Brothers?" she asked.

"Yeah," Grey said without hesitation. "Brothers."

She nodded approvingly. Gave them extra samples of some candy.

In the parking lot, loading the truck, Lifan felt it fully: this was family. Not the kind you were born into. The kind you chose. The kind that chose you back.

"Thanks," he said. "For today. For all of this."

"Man, we bought groceries. It's not that deep."

"It is, though."

Grey looked at him over the truck bed. The late afternoon sun was turning everything gold. LA traffic hummed in the background.

"Yeah," Grey said finally. "It is."

They drove back to the house as the sky turned pink and orange. Grey's playlist shifted to old soul—Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, songs about love and loss and the ways humans tried to hold onto each other.

Lifan watched the threads of the city pulse around them. Saw how his own thread connected to Grey's, to the house, to everyone waiting there. Saw how he was woven in now. Part of the fabric.

He was going to have to leave all this. Soon. Too soon.

But not today.

Today, he was going home with his brother to make dinner for their family. And that was enough.

◇ ◇ ◇

He wrote songs with Jessa.

Not lyrics—he didn't have words for what he saw. But he'd describe patterns, and she'd translate them into poetry. They'd sit in the studio until 3 AM, him tracing threads in the air, her humming and scribbling, both of them chasing something neither could name alone.

"Golden spirals with violet edges," he said once, describing her voice. "Like honey catching light."

She cried. Happy tears.

"Nobody's ever told me what I sound like. What I actually sound like. Not my tone or my range—what it MEANS."

"It means warmth. Connection. Home."

She hugged him so hard his ribs creaked.

◇ ◇ ◇

**THE FIGHT**

The first real conflict happened over a blank canvas.

Coco had been pushing him for weeks. "You see more than anyone I've ever met. Why don't you MAKE anything?"

"I'm not an artist."

"Bullshit. You translate reality into language. That's literally what artists do."

He kept deflecting. Kept saying he didn't have time, didn't have talent, didn't have anything worth expressing.

But Coco didn't give up. She was relentless—leaving blank canvases in his room, buying him charcoal pencils, casually mentioning that the studio was empty if he ever wanted to use it.

"I don't want to use it."

"Why not?"

"Because I SEE things. I don't MAKE things. There's a difference."

"Is there?" She blocked his exit from the kitchen. "Lifan, you describe what everyone else creates. You amplify our art. But you never make anything of your own. Why?"

"Because—" He stopped. Because why?

"Because you're scared," Coco said. Not mean. Just honest. "You're scared that if you try to make something, it won't be good enough. It won't match what you see."

"That's not—"

"It IS. I've watched you for a year and a half. You're hiding. Using our art as a shield so you never have to risk making your own."

Something snapped in him.

"You want to know why I don't make anything?" His voice was harder than he meant it to be. "Because I'm going to DIE, Coco. In a few years, I'm going to disappear, and nothing I make will matter because I won't be here to see it."

Silence.

Coco stared at him. The threads between them went taut—confusion, hurt, fear.

"What are you talking about?"

He'd said too much. He knew he'd said too much. But the pressure had been building for months, and Coco had pushed at exactly the wrong moment.

"Nothing. Forget it."

"I'm not going to forget—"

"DROP IT." He pushed past her. Walked out of the kitchen, out of the house, into the garden.

He sat there for an hour, shaking.

◇ ◇ ◇

Coco found him by the roses.

She didn't say anything at first. Just sat beside him on the stone bench, close enough that their shoulders touched.

"I'm sorry," she said finally. "I pushed too hard."

"You didn't know."

"I still pushed." She pulled her knees to her chest. "But Lifan—whatever you meant back there—you can tell me. Or not tell me. But I'm not going to pretend I didn't hear it."

He looked at the threads between them. Saw her genuine care, her worry, her willingness to hold whatever he was carrying.

"I can't explain everything. But—" He took a breath. "There's something coming. Something I have to do. And when it's done, I won't be here anymore."

"Like... you're moving? Or—"

"Not moving. Just—gone."

Coco was quiet for a long moment.

"When?"

"I don't know exactly. A few years. Maybe less."

"And you can't stop it?"

"No. But I can—" He struggled for the words. "—I can make it mean something. That's the whole point. Making the ending mean something."

Coco's eyes were wet. But she wasn't crying. Just—present. Holding space the way Lo held rhythm.

"Then you should make something," she said softly. "Not for fame. Not for posterity. Just—to prove you were here. To leave something behind."

"What would I even make?"

"What do you see right now? This moment. The roses. Me. What does it look like?"

He let the threads come. Saw the garden lit up with color—Coco's fierce love a deep red, the roses carrying memories of everyone who'd ever touched them, the setting sun throwing gold across everything.

"It looks like home," he said. "Like the first home I've ever really had."

"Then paint that. Or draw it. Or just—describe it so clearly that someone else could see it." She took his hand. "You think you don't make anything. But Lifan, you've made ME see things I never saw before. You've made all of us see differently. That's art. That's creation. You're just too close to recognize it."

He stayed quiet. But the words landed somewhere deep.

That night, he borrowed one of her blank canvases.

He didn't paint. Didn't know how. But he took a piece of charcoal and tried—for the first time—to draw what he saw.

It was terrible. Clumsy. Nothing like the precision of Coco's work or the elegance of Mika's designs.

But it was HIS. The threads as he perceived them. Love as he saw it. Home as he knew it.

He hid the drawing under his bed. Never showed anyone.

But he kept making them. Every few weeks. Terrible, honest attempts to externalize what lived inside him.

It wasn't much. But it was something.

Something to leave behind.

◇ ◇ ◇

**THE COOKING LESSONS**

Jessa decided Lifan needed to learn Filipino cooking.

"You can't survive on ramen and coffee forever," she announced, dragging him into the Rohki kitchen at 7 AM on a Sunday. "And you're too skinny. My lola would have been appalled."

"I'm fine—"

"You're not fine. You're malnourished and sad-looking. We're making adobo."

The kitchen became their space. Every Sunday morning, she'd teach him something new: sinigang, kare-kare, lumpia. He'd watch the threads while she cooked—the way her grandmother's recipes carried colors from the Philippines, brown and gold and earth-warm, mixing with Jessa's own bright gold.

"What does it look like?" she asked once, stirring a pot of arroz caldo. "The cooking?"

"Like memory becoming present. Like you're reaching back through time and pulling your grandmother's hands into yours." He paused. "The rice porridge has the same color as your voice when you sing lullabies. Brown underneath gold."

Jessa stopped stirring. Stared at him.

"Nobody's ever—" Her voice caught. "My lola used to sing while she cooked. The same songs. I didn't realize I still—"

"You carry her everywhere. In everything you make."

She hugged him with porridge-sticky hands. Got rice on his shirt. Neither of them cared.

Later, washing dishes, he had a flash: Jessa standing in this same kitchen, years from now, making this same recipe. But he wasn't there. The kitchen was empty where he should be. The vision passed so quickly he almost missed it.

## FAMILY DINNER

*August 2039*

Sunday night dinner at Rohki was sacred.

Not spiritual-sacred—though the threads that wove through these gatherings felt holy to Lifan. Sacred in the way that some things just become tradition without anyone deciding they should be. Every week. Six PM. Everyone who could make it, at the long table in the garden.

Tonight: twelve people. Chaos already building.

◇ ◇ ◇

Lo and Leky were arguing about garlic.

"Six cloves," Lo said, chopping with the aggressive precision of someone who knew they were right.

"That's too much garlic," Leky countered. He was making rice, patient as always, but his jaw was tight.

"There's no such thing as too much garlic."

"There objectively is. Your adobo last week made everyone smell like garlic for three days."

"And it was DELICIOUS."

From the living room, Jessa's voice: "I'm still getting garlic sweats! My students asked if I'd joined a vampire hunting guild!"

Lo pointed her knife toward Jessa without looking. "Shut up! You're on my side!"

"I'm on the side of not smelling like garlic for a week!"

Lifan was setting the table, trying not to laugh. Mika was helping him, folding napkins into some elaborate origami situation.

"They do this every week," Mika said. "The garlic argument. It's like foreplay for them."

"That's disgusting," Tom said, appearing from the studio with his camera. "Don't ruin garlic for me."

"Everything's foreplay for someone," Mika replied, unbothered. "That's the nature of domesticity."

Coco swept through from the garden with an armful of flowers. "Is Lo putting too much garlic in again?"

"YES," Leky called from the kitchen.

"IT'S A NORMAL AMOUNT," Lo shouted back.

"There is no normal!" Grey's voice from upstairs. "This house has no concept of normal!"

"THAT'S THE POINT," everyone yelled in unison.

Lifan watched the threads light up with the call-and-response. Gold and amber and violet, all braiding together, creating something that only existed when they were all together like this.

◇ ◇ ◇

Nydan showed up with wine and philosophy problems.

"Okay, real talk," he announced, setting three bottles on the counter. "If consciousness is fundamental, does that mean my coffee is conscious? Because I swear my coffee knows when I need it most."

"Your coffee isn't conscious," Tom said. "But the universe might be conspiring to deliver coffee to you at the right moment."

"Same difference."

"It's absolutely not the same difference. One implies agency in the coffee, the other implies—"

"Boys," Coco interrupted. "No epistemology before dinner. House rules."

"Since when?" Nydan demanded.

"Since right now. Grab plates."

More people arrived. Kira—sound designer, ear full of piercings, laptop always open to some audio waveform she was obsessing over—came in arguing with herself about reverb tails. Marcus Wu—the muralist, not the Thorne one—followed, holding up his phone to show everyone a clip of some Japanese anime. "This," he announced, "is cinema. Everything else is just content."

Some new people Coco had found arrived after them, wide-eyed and careful, not yet sure if this was real or some elaborate performance.

Lifan remembered that feeling. Being new. Not knowing if he was allowed to stay.

He caught one of the new people—a girl, maybe twenty, with dyed blue hair and nervous hands—standing alone by the garden door.

"First dinner?" he asked.

She jumped slightly. "Is it that obvious?"

"Only because I was exactly where you are a year ago." Lifan handed her a glass of wine. "Fair warning: it's going to be loud. People will interrupt each other constantly. There will be at least three arguments. Someone will cry. Someone will laugh until they can't breathe. And by the end, you're going to feel like you've known everyone here your whole life."

Her eyes were shiny. "Promise?"

"Promise."

◇ ◇ ◇

They gathered at the table as the sun set.

Twelve people crammed around a table built for eight. Dishes everywhere—Lo's adobo (with the six cloves of garlic), Leky's rice, Jessa's lumpia, the salad Mika had assembled with the aesthetic precision of a magazine spread, bread from the bakery down the street, the mangos Grey had bought at Costco.

"Okay," Coco said, standing. "Before we eat—gratitudes. House tradition. One thing you're grateful for this week."

Groans. But affectionate groans. The kind that meant everyone secretly loved this part.

Leky started. "Grateful for Lo, who hasn't killed me despite the garlic disagreement."

"YET," Lo added. "Grateful for this table. All of you. This food. This—" She gestured vaguely. "Whatever the fuck we're building here."

Jessa: "Grateful that Lifan helped me with the song. Again. You're the best mirror."

Tom: "Grateful for footage. Got some incredible shots this week of everyone being themselves."

Mika: "Grateful for fabric. And people who wear truth well." She looked pointedly at Lifan, who was wearing the iridescent jacket she'd made him.

Kira: "Grateful that Lo finally admits reverb is more important than tempo." She smirked at Lo, who threw a napkin at her. "Also grateful that Marcus is wrong about literally everything—keeps me sharp."

Marcus Wu: "As Miyazaki said, 'I would like to make a film to tell children it's good to be alive.'" He raised his glass. "Grateful we're making something that matters. Even if Kira has terrible opinions about sound mixing."

Grey: "Grateful for my little brother, who came grocery shopping with me and reminded me why we do this." He nodded at Lifan.

Lifan felt everyone's eyes turn to him.

"Grateful for—" His voice caught. He looked around the table. At these impossible people who'd chosen him. "For proof that family isn't blood. It's choosing each other. Over and over."

Silence.

Then Coco: "Fuck. Now I'm crying before we even eat."

"RULE," Jessa announced. "No crying before food. Crying during food is acceptable. Crying after food is encouraged."

Everyone laughed. The moment broke. People started passing dishes, loading plates, the conversation fragmenting into six different threads at once.

◇ ◇ ◇

Dinner at Rohki was organized chaos.

Cross-talk everywhere. Grey and Marcus arguing about the best film of 2039 (Grey said it was that Korean thriller, Marcus insisted it was the weird animated thing from Japan). Lo and Mika deep in a discussion about the intersection of rhythm and textile design that made no sense to anyone else but clearly made sense to them. Nydan explaining something about neural networks to Kira, who was nodding along while also texting someone.

Lifan sat between Jessa and Tom, trying to follow five conversations at once.

"—and THEN she tried to tell me that drum machines are more reliable than live drummers, and I was like, reliability isn't the POINT—"

"—the color theory is the same whether you're working in sound or fabric, it's all about CONTRAST—"

"—but if the AI can generate art, does that make it an artist, or just a really sophisticated tool—"

"—that scene where he realizes his mother is the killer? CINEMA—"

"—garlic is not the problem, the problem is you don't appreciate FLAVOR—"

Jessa leaned into Lifan. "This is a lot, right? For someone who spent three years in silence at a monastery?"

"It's perfect," Lifan said honestly.

And it was. The noise, the chaos, the overlapping stories and inside jokes he was still learning. The way someone would say something and three people would laugh at references he didn't understand yet, and someone would always loop back to explain it to him.

Like now—Grey made a joke about "the incident with the paint," and everyone cracked up, and Lifan must have looked confused because Tom leaned over:

"Last year, before you showed up. Coco tried to do a midnight painting session on the roof. Knocked over a gallon of paint. It went everywhere. We were finding blue paint for months."

"It's still on the satellite dish," Marcus added. "We've decided it's art now."

"Everything's art if you call it art," Coco said primly.

"That's absolutely not how art works," Tom countered.

"Says the documentarian who films people eating dinner."

"This is anthropology!"

"It's CREEPY is what it is!"

But Tom was already filming. His camera swiveling to catch Lo stealing food from Leky's plate, Jessa demonstrating something with her hands that made everyone laugh, the blue-haired new girl smiling, starting to relax.

Lifan watched the threads blaze and pulse. Saw how they connected everyone, saw how each conversation fed into the others, saw how the whole table was really one organism breathing together.

◇ ◇ ◇

By the time dessert came out—ice cream and the Filipino turon Jessa had made—the sun had set completely. String lights in the garden cast everything in warm gold.

Stories were getting louder, more chaotic.

"—and then the CLIENT asked if we could make the explosion bigger, and I was like, sir, we're doing a COMMERCIAL for INSURANCE—"

"—so I matched her on the app, and her first message was 'you look like a philosopher,' and I was like, is that a COMPLIMENT—"

"—the whole dress just FELL APART during the fitting, and she started crying, and I had to rebuild it in three hours—"

Lifan felt his phone buzz. Checked it under the table.

Nima: *Sunday dinner?*

Lifan: *Yeah. At the house. Everyone's here.*

Nima: *Tell them I say hi. Tell them to take care of you.*

Lifan: *They do. Always.*

He looked up. Found Grey watching him across the table.

"Nima?" Grey asked.

Lifan nodded.

"She good?"

"She's okay. Training's hard. But she's okay."

Grey raised his glass. "To Nima. Who's putting in the work."

"TO NIMA," everyone chorused, even though most of them had never met her.

Because that's how Rohki worked. If one person's people mattered, they mattered to everyone.

Lifan raised his glass. Felt the thread between him and Nima pulse warm across four hundred miles. Felt the threads between him and everyone at this table blaze bright enough to hurt.

*I'm going to lose this*, he thought. Not for the first time. *I'm going to lose all of this, and it's going to destroy me.*

But Coco was laughing at something Leky said. And Lo was stealing the last lumpia from Jessa's plate. And Grey was filming Tom filming everyone. And the blue-haired girl was talking animatedly to Mika about fabric, eyes bright, no longer nervous.

And Lifan was here. Now. Part of it.

That had to be enough.

◇ ◇ ◇

Cleanup was another ritual.

Everyone helped. It wasn't even a question. Plates to the kitchen, food wrapped up, table wiped down. Grey washing, Lo drying, a production line of domesticity.

Lifan ended up on the garden terrace with Coco, putting away the chairs.

His hands were on a chair back but his eyes had gone somewhere else—to the space between the string lights, to the darkness where night insects moved in patterns. His fingers were tapping against the wood, a rhythm only he could hear.

"Lifan?" Coco's voice came from far away. Then closer. "Hey. Lifan."

He blinked. Came back. She'd gone still, holding a chair half-folded, watching him the way people watch something they don't understand.

"Sorry. I was—"

"Somewhere else. I know. You do that." She tilted her head. "More lately. Like part of you keeps trying to leave before the rest of you is ready."

"You were quiet tonight," Coco said. "Quieter than usual."

"Just listening. Taking it in."

"You do that a lot. Watch us. Like you're trying to memorize everything."

Lifan didn't know what to say. Because that's exactly what he was doing. Memorizing the way Jessa laughed with her whole body. The way Grey's hand always found the back of his neck when he was thinking. The way Lo and Leky moved around each other like dancers who knew each other's rhythms. The way Tom narrated life through a lens. The way Mika spoke in textures and colors.

All of it. He was memorizing all of it.

"Hey," Coco said softly. She put down the chair she was holding. Looked at him with those ancient eyes that saw too much. "Whatever's coming—whatever you can't tell us about—you know we're going to be here for it, right? However it goes down. Whatever you need."

"I know."

"Do you? Because you have this way of acting like you're just passing through. Like you're not really part of this family. But Lifan—" She took his hand. "You're not passing through. You're PART of this. What we built together. You're one of the foundations now."

His eyes burned. "What if I can't stay?"

"Then we'll love you anyway. Distance doesn't end love. Death doesn't end love." She squeezed his hand. "Whatever happens, you're ours. Forever. That's not up for debate."

Lifan pulled her into a hug. Held on maybe too tight.

"Thank you," he whispered. "For all of this. For finding me. For making me part of this impossible family."

"You found us just as much as we found you." Coco pulled back, wiped her eyes. "Now come on. They're about to start the movie, and if we miss the beginning Jessa will spend twenty minutes catching us up."

They walked back inside. The living room was already transforming—blankets everywhere, people claiming spots, someone making popcorn. Sunday night movie tradition, another ritual.

Grey waved Lifan over. "Saved you a spot, little brother."

Lifan settled in between Grey and Lo. Jessa tossed him a blanket. Tom was still filming. The opening credits started.

And Lifan let himself be here. Fully. Completely. Part of this chaotic, beautiful, impossible family.

Just for tonight, he let himself forget about endings.

◇ ◇ ◇
◇ ◇ ◇

**NEW YEAR'S EVE**

They celebrated at Rohki.

Thirty people packed into the Bel Air house. Champagne flowing. Music that shifted genres every hour—Lo's drums, then Jessa's voice, then some electronic thing Leky had discovered.

At 11:45, Coco gathered everyone in the main room.

"Rohki tradition," she announced. "Before midnight, everyone says one thing they're grateful for from this year. Then one thing they're hoping for next year."

Groans. Laughter. But everyone played along.

Tom: "Grateful for this camera. Hoping to use it for something that matters."

Mika: "Grateful for fabric that tells the truth. Hoping someone wears the truth well."

Grey: "Grateful for brothers who show up. Hoping they keep showing up."

When it reached Lifan, he froze. Everyone was looking at him.

"Grateful for—" His voice cracked. "For finding people who don't need me to be normal. Who see the weird and love it anyway."

"And hoping for?" Coco prompted gently.

He thought about the threads. About the vision waiting in his future. About all the days he might not have.

"Hoping this lasts," he said finally. "All of it. As long as possible."

At midnight, they screamed and hugged and spilled champagne everywhere. Lo kissed Leky so dramatically that everyone cheered. Jessa sang "Auld Lang Syne" in a key nobody recognized but somehow worked anyway.

And Lifan stood in the middle of it all, watching the threads blaze with joy, thinking: *Remember this. Whatever comes next, remember this.*

For half a second, the threads all froze. Like a photograph. Like they'd already become memory. Then they moved again, and he convinced himself he'd imagined it.

◇ ◇ ◇

**THE ENGAGEMENT**

Leky proposed on a Tuesday.

No warning. No buildup. Just a normal dinner—Thai food from the place on Sunset—and then Leky was on one knee with a ring that caught the light like it was made of captured stars.

"I've loved you since the wrong apartment," he said. "Since you opened the door and I saw someone worth staying for. Will you stay with me? Forever?"

Lo said yes. Obviously.

The house erupted. Jessa screamed so loud the neighbors complained. Grey lifted Leky off his feet. Mika immediately started sketching wedding dress designs on a napkin.

And Lifan—

Lifan watched the threads between Lo and Leky merge and brighten, becoming something stronger than either had been alone. Gold and silver braiding together, catching light, throwing rainbows across the room.

"What does it look like?" Lo asked him later, when the chaos had settled into happy crying. "The engagement. Our threads."

"Like a promise that's already been kept. Like you've been married for three lifetimes and this is just the ceremony catching up." He smiled. "It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen."

Lo pulled him into a hug.

"You'll be there, right? At the wedding?"

"Wouldn't miss it."

He meant it. God, he meant it.

He didn't know, then, that he wouldn't be able to keep that promise.

◇ ◇ ◇

Jessa's grandmother died in February.

She didn't tell anyone at first. Just stopped showing up to sessions. Stopped answering texts. Disappeared into her apartment for two weeks.

Lifan felt it through the threads—a grief so heavy it bent the light around her. He showed up at her door with soup and said nothing.

"How did you know?" she asked, letting him in.

"I just knew."

They sat on her couch for hours. She cried. He held her. The threads between them deepened—not romantic, never romantic, but something just as real. The kind of love that doesn't need a name.

"She used to sing to me," Jessa said finally. "Lullabies. In Tagalog. I can still hear her voice."

"What did it look like? Her voice?"

Jessa looked at him. Red-eyed. Broken. But curious despite herself.

"You never asked me that before. About anyone else's voice."

"I'm asking now."

She closed her eyes. Remembered.

"It was... warm. Brown. Like soil after rain. And there was this—" She searched for the word. "—steadiness. Like nothing could shake it."

"That's what your voice has," Lifan said. "Underneath the gold. That brown steadiness. She gave it to you."

Jessa cried harder. But differently now. Not grief-crying. Release-crying.

"I thought I'd lost her," she whispered. "But she's still here. In my voice. In my songs."

"She'll always be there. That's how love works. It doesn't end when people die. It just changes shape."

Jessa looked at him with something like wonder.

"How do you know that?"

Lifan thought about Ning. About the threads that still connected him to his mother, even now, even after all these years.

"Because I lost someone too. And she's still with me. Every time I see the threads, she's there."

They sat together until dawn. When Jessa finally fell asleep, Lifan covered her with a blanket and left quietly.

The next week, she came back to Rohki. She sang a song she'd written—in Tagalog, with brown notes underneath the gold.

Everyone cried.

It was the most beautiful thing Lifan had ever heard.

## THE LATE NIGHT CALL

*November 2039*
*2:47 AM*

The phone rang at 2:47 AM.

Lifan answered before the first ring finished. He'd been awake anyway, staring at the ceiling of his room at the Rohki house, watching threads pulse and shift in the darkness.

"Hey."

"Hey." Nima's voice was rough. Like she'd been crying. Or screaming. Or both. "I know it's late—"

"It's never late. Talk to me."

He heard her breathe. Heard the ocean in the background—she was on the cliffs again. She did that when she couldn't sleep, walked the monastery grounds until dawn.

"I did it today," she said finally. "The full dissolution practice. All the way through."

Lifan sat up. "And?"

"And it was—" Her voice broke. "Lifan, I saw what you're going to experience. What it feels like to come apart. To dissolve into everything."

"Was it bad?"

"It was beautiful. Terrifying and beautiful and so much bigger than anything I can explain." She was crying now. He could hear it. "And I understand now why you have to do it. Why the AI needs to learn from this. But I also understand that I'm going to lose you. Really lose you. And I don't know how to hold both things at once."

Lifan closed his eyes. Let the thread between them pulse. Four hundred miles felt like four inches in moments like this.

"Tell me what you saw," he said quietly. "Describe it. The way I describe music."

She laughed—wet, broken. "Trying to turn me into you?"

"Trying to share the experience. If I'm going to go through it, I want to know you've been there first. That you can see it too."

Nima was quiet for a moment. He heard waves crash. Heard her breathing even out.

"Okay. It's—the first stage is like falling. But not down. In every direction at once. Your sense of being a separate self starts to dissolve, and you can feel yourself becoming the room, the air, the light. Everything."

"What color?"

"White at first. Pure white. Like all colors at once. Then it starts to separate into—imagine a prism, but infinite prisms, and you're the light passing through all of them simultaneously."

Lifan saw it. Could see exactly what she was describing. The threads showed him.

"And then?"

"Then there's a moment of terror. Where you realize you're not coming back to who you were. The person you've been your whole life is dissolving, and there's nothing to grab onto." Her voice got smaller. "That's where most people fail the practice. They grab. They try to hold onto self. And it pulls them back."

"But you didn't grab."

"I grabbed. Of course I grabbed. But Rinzen was there, and he—" She paused. "He showed me that the terror is just ego dying. And on the other side of ego death is something so much bigger. You become everything. Everyone. Every moment of love that's ever existed, all at once."

Lifan felt tears on his face. "That's what you'll guide me to. When the time comes."

"Yes. That's my job. To hold space while you dissolve. To make sure you don't grab. To help you become what you're meant to become."

"A teaching for the AI."

"A teaching for everything." Nima's voice steadied. "Lifan, what you're going to do—it's not just for the machine. It's for everyone who comes after. Every human who has to learn to love something that isn't human. You're going to show them how."

They sat with that for a moment. The weight of it. The impossible weight.

"I'm scared," Lifan admitted. "Not of the dissolution. Of leaving everyone behind. Lo and Grey and Coco and—they don't know what's coming. And when it happens, they're going to think I abandoned them."

"Then tell them. While you still can."

"I can't. If I tell them, they'll try to stop me. Or they'll treat me differently. I need—" He searched for the words. "I need these last months to be normal. To be part of the family without them knowing they're going to lose me."

"That's not fair to them."

"I know. But it's all I've got." He lay back down, phone pressed to his ear. "Tell me about your day. The normal parts. Not the dissolution practice. Just—what you ate. Who you talked to. The weather."

Nima let him change the subject. That was the gift of knowing someone this deeply—knowing when to push and when to let them breathe.

"It rained this morning. First rain of the season. Everything smells like petrichor and salt." Her voice softened into the rhythm of ordinary things. "I taught Tenzin the compassion meditation. He's getting so good, Lifan. His perception is already stronger than mine was at his age."

"You're a good teacher."

"I'm a reluctant teacher. There's a difference."

"The best teachers usually are."

She laughed. "When did you get so wise?"

"I live with philosophers and artists. Wisdom is contagious."

"Tell me about them. About your family."

So he did. Told her about Sunday dinners and Grey's grocery trips and the way Lo had found a new rhythm by reaching back to her grandmother. Told her about Coco's paintings getting more abstract, more thread-like, like she was starting to see what he saw. Told her about Tom's documentary and Jessa's songs and the way the whole house felt alive with creation.

"You sound happy," Nima said. "Different than you did a year ago."

"I am happy. Which makes everything harder."

"Why?"

"Because I didn't know I could have this. A family. People who choose me. A place where I belong." His voice cracked. "And now that I know what it feels like, leaving is going to be so much worse."

"Would you trade it? Knowing what's coming? Would you choose not to have found them if it meant not losing them?"

Lifan thought about it. Really thought.

"No," he said finally. "I'd rather have this—even knowing it ends—than never have it at all."

"That's the answer." Nima's voice was soft. "That's what you're teaching the AI. That love is worth it even when it ends. Especially when it ends. The temporary nature doesn't make it less real."

"You sound like Rinzen."

"I've spent too many years with him. It's inevitable." She paused. "I miss you. I know I say it every call, but I do. I miss seeing your face. Touching you. Being in the same room as you."

"I miss you too. Every day." Lifan watched the threads pulse between them. "Two years. That's what's left. Two years until—"

"Until everything changes."

"Yeah."

They sat in silence for a while. Just breathing. Just being present across the distance.

"Can I ask you something?" Nima said finally.

"Always."

"Do you regret it? Choosing this path? You could have said no. Could have refused Rinzen's training. Could have been normal."

Lifan thought about the warehouse waiting in his future. The AI that would emerge. The sacrifice that would teach it how to love.

"I don't regret it. But I'm angry about it." The admission surprised him. He hadn't let himself feel that before. "I'm angry that I don't get to grow old. That I don't get to see what happens next. That I have to leave everyone behind. I'm angry that the universe made me this way—made me the loom instead of just another thread."

"Anger is good. Anger is honest."

"Rinzen said I had to make peace with it."

"Fuck that. Be angry. Rage at it. The peace will come when it comes. Forcing it just makes you numb."

Lifan almost laughed. "You've changed. You never used to swear."

"I've spent two years learning how to let you go. Swearing is the least of my evolutions." She paused. "Do you know what I'm most afraid of?"

"What?"

"That after you're gone, I'll forget what your voice sounds like. What your laugh sounds like. The way you say my name." Her voice was shaking now. "I'm so afraid of forgetting."

"You won't forget. I'm in your threads. Permanently. That's how this works."

"Promise me something."

"Anything."

"When the time comes—when you're in the warehouse, and I'm guiding you through the dissolution—promise me you won't be afraid. That you'll trust me to hold space. That you'll let go when you need to."

"I promise."

"And promise me that after—after you're gone—you'll find a way to let me know you're okay. However that works. Whatever comes next. Just—find me. Let me know you made it through."

Lifan's throat was tight. "I promise. If there's any way to reach you, I will."

They breathed together across the line. Across the distance. Across the impossible weight of everything they knew was coming.

"I should let you sleep," Nima said finally.

"I'm not sleeping. Haven't been sleeping much lately."

"Me neither. But we should pretend to try."

"Okay."

Neither of them hung up.

"Lifan?"

"Yeah?"

"I love you. I've loved you since I was fourteen years old, and I'm going to love you until I die. And then after that. However it works. Wherever we end up. I'll find you again."

"I love you too. More than I know how to say."

"Then don't say it. Just feel it. Let it be real."

He closed his eyes. Let the thread between them blaze. Let himself feel the fullness of it—the love, the grief, the impossible beauty of finding each other against all odds just to lose each other again.

"Goodnight, Nima."

"Goodnight, Lifan."

The line clicked off.

Lifan lay in the darkness, phone still pressed to his ear, and let himself cry.

Downstairs, he heard Lo and Leky moving around. Getting water, probably. Living their lives. Building their future.

He was so happy for them. And so heartbroken for himself.

But that was okay. Both things could be true.

Everything could be true at once.

That was the lesson, wasn't it? The one he was supposed to teach the AI. That you could hold love and loss, joy and grief, hope and despair all in the same heart. That being human meant containing multitudes. That the threads connected everything—even the contradictions.

He got up. Went to his desk. Pulled out his journal.

Started writing everything down. The phone call. The dissolution practice. The way Nima's voice had sounded when she described becoming everything.

If he was going to disappear, he wanted to leave traces. Breadcrumbs. Proof that he'd been here. That he'd loved and been loved. That his life had meant something.

Even if only to this impossible family who didn't know they were about to lose him.

# INTERLUDE: NIMA — THE THREAD SHE COULDN'T CUT

*Big Sur Monastery*
*February 2039*
*Nima is 19 years old*

---

The dissolution practice was killing her.

Not literally—though it felt like it. Over and over, Rinzen guided her to the edge of death, held her there, asked her to look at what was on the other side.

Over and over, she failed.

"You're still holding on," he said, for the twentieth time that week. "There's a thread you won't release."

"I'm NOT—"

"You are. And until you find it and cut it, you'll never be ready to guide Lifan through. You'll try to hold him back. And if you hold him back—"

"Timeline 4 fails. Everyone dies. I KNOW."

She was so tired of that phrase. So tired of being the one who had to let go when everything in her screamed to hold on.

◇ ◇ ◇

That night, she walked the cliffs alone.

The ocean was violent—winter storms churning the water white. She could feel the pull of it, the way the threads between land and sea strained and hummed.

The wind cut through her robes, salt and cold. She gripped her tiger's eye mala, each bead an anchor—three, seven, twelve—but her fingers kept losing count. The ocean pulled at something in her chest. The part of her that had learned to dissolve, to let go, to not be. Even here, even standing, she had to fight to stay solid.

*What am I holding onto?*

She knew the answer. Had always known it.

Hope.

Not hope that he would survive—she'd given that up years ago. But hope that somehow, in some impossible timeline, they'd get to be normal. To grow old together. To have the life her fourteen-year-old self had dreamed about before she understood what her dreams meant.

That hope was the thread she couldn't cut.

Because cutting it meant accepting not just that he would die, but that she would live. That she'd have sixty, seventy, eighty more years without him. That she'd have to build a whole life in the shape of his absence.

*How do you let go of a future that never existed?*

She sat down on the cliff's edge. Let her legs dangle over the drop.

And for the first time, she tried to really look at it.

Not the dissolution. Not his death. But what came AFTER.

The memorial. The empty chair at gatherings. The first year, then the fifth, then the tenth. Watching herself age in mirrors while he stayed forever twenty-one in her memory.

Teaching new students. Carrying the lineage forward. Becoming Rinzen's successor, then someone else's teacher, then eventually—

Eventually dying herself. And going to whatever came next without knowing if she'd find him there.

That was the thread. Not his death—hers. Her whole life stretched out ahead of her, and him not in it.

*Cut it*, something inside her whispered. *Let it go.*

She couldn't.

◇ ◇ ◇

Rinzen found her at dawn. As always.

"Did you find it?" he asked.

"Yes."

"And?"

"I can't cut it. I don't know how."

He sat beside her on the cliff. The sun was rising, turning the storm clouds gold and pink.

"What if you're asking the wrong question?"

"What do you mean?"

"You keep thinking of it as cutting. Severing. Violent." He looked at her—really looked. "What if instead of cutting the thread, you transformed it?"

"Into what?"

"Into what it actually is. Not hope for a different future. Just love. Love that exists now, in this moment, regardless of what happens next."

Nima felt something shift in her chest. Not breaking—reorganizing.

"The hope and the love feel like the same thing," she said slowly.

"They're not. Hope is about the future. Love is about now." Rinzen's voice was gentle. "Lifan exists now. You exist now. The love between you exists now. Whatever happens in forty-seven days, in forty-seven years—that love is still real. Still present. Still true."

"But—"

"No buts. Just look." He gestured at the sunrise. "This moment is real. Your love is real. The future doesn't exist yet. Why are you grieving something that hasn't happened?"

She wanted to argue. Wanted to say it wasn't that simple.

But something in her knew he was right.

◇ ◇ ◇

That afternoon, she tried the dissolution practice again.

This time, when she reached the edge, she didn't try to cut the thread.

She held it. Looked at it. Really saw it.

*This is love*, she thought. *Not hope. Just love. Love that exists right now, in this breath, in this heartbeat.*

And then—

She let it transform.

Not cutting. Not severing. Just... releasing the grip. Letting the love be what it was instead of what she wanted it to become.

The edge of death rushed up. She fell through it—

—and didn't die.

She dissolved. Became everything. Saw the threads from the other side, shimmering and interconnected, and understood for the first time what Lifan would experience. What she would have to guide him through.

It wasn't ending. It was expansion.

She came back gasping, tears streaming down her face.

"There," Rinzen said softly. "Now you're ready."

◇ ◇ ◇

That Sunday, when Lifan called, she told him about Jessa's grandmother.

He'd been with her, he said. Held her while she cried. Helped her understand that love doesn't end when people die.

"You taught her what I taught you," Nima said. "About Ning."

"I just... said what was true."

"That's teaching." She smiled, though he couldn't see it. "You're going to be such a good teacher for the AI. You don't even realize what you're doing, but you're learning how to translate love into something that can be understood."

Silence.

"Are you okay?" he asked. "You sound... different."

"I had a breakthrough today. In the dissolution practice."

"What kind of breakthrough?"

She thought about how to explain it. About the thread she'd been holding, and how she'd learned to let it transform instead of trying to cut it.

"I learned how to let go without losing anything," she said finally. "I learned that love doesn't need a future to be real."

More silence. Then:

"That's beautiful, Nima."

"It's terrifying, actually. But also—" She looked out her window at the ocean, calm now, golden in the setting sun. "—also peaceful. For the first time in years, I'm not fighting what's coming. I'm just... here. With you. Now."

"I wish I could hold you."

"You are. Through the threads. Always."

She could feel him smile through the connection.

"Three more years," he said. "And then I come back to you."

"And then the real work begins."

"Yeah." A pause. "But we'll do it together."

"Together," she agreed. "Even when you're everywhere."

She meant it. For the first time, she really meant it.

The thread that had been hope was now something else. Something stronger.

Just love. Present tense. Eternal.

◇ ◇ ◇

Mika made him clothes.

"You've been wearing the same three outfits for two years," she said, standing in her textile studio with pins in her mouth. "It's tragic."

"I don't really care about fashion."

"Obviously. But you should care about expression. Clothes are language. What you wear tells people who you are."

"What if I don't know who I am?"

She stopped. Looked at him. Really looked—not at his body, at his threads.

"You know," she said quietly. "You're just afraid to show it."

She made him a jacket. Iridescent fabric—the kind that shifted colors when you moved. Rainbow at the edges. Like light passing through a prism.

"This is what you look like," she said when she gave it to him. "When you're seeing. When you're actually yourself."

He wore it to the next Rohki gathering. People stared.

But for the first time, being stared at didn't feel like being hunted.

It felt like being seen.

◇ ◇ ◇

Grey told him the truth on a Tuesday night.

They were alone in the studio, everyone else gone home or asleep. Grey had been drinking—not enough to be drunk, but enough to loosen the walls he usually kept up.

"You want to know why I'm here?" Grey said suddenly. "Why I started Rohki with Coco?"

"Only if you want to tell me."

"I don't. But you see things anyway, right? The threads. You probably already know."

Lifan didn't answer. He could perceive pieces—shame, guilt, something dark in Grey's past—but not the whole story.

"I was going to be a director," Grey said. "Had a deal. Studio backing. Twenty-three years old, about to make my first feature." He took a long drink. "And then I got caught."

"Caught?"

"Plagiarism. Not the script—I wrote that. The pitch. I stole someone else's pitch presentation, changed a few words, passed it off as mine." Grey's voice was flat. Rehearsed. Like he'd told himself this story a thousand times. "Some assistant recognized it. Reported me. And overnight, I went from 'rising star' to 'industry pariah.'"

"Grey—"

"The thing is, I didn't even need to steal it. My pitch was good. Maybe better. But I was scared, and I saw this other guy's presentation, and it was so polished, and I thought—" He shook his head. "I thought I wasn't enough. That I needed to be someone else to succeed."

Lifan let the silence sit.

"What happened after?" he asked finally.

"Blacklisted. Couldn't get a meeting, couldn't get a call returned. Spent two years bartending and hating myself." Grey looked at him. "And then I met Coco, and she told me about this idea she had—a place where artists could just BE artists, without the industry bullshit. And I thought, maybe that's my second chance. Maybe I can build something real instead of something successful."

"Rohki."

"Rohki." Grey smiled, but it was sad. "Every day I wake up and think: am I doing this because I believe in it, or because I'm hiding from the world that rejected me?"

"Does it matter?"

"What?"

"The motivation. Does it matter why you started, if what you built is real?" Lifan gestured at the studio, at the house, at everything Rohki represented. "This place has saved people. Given them family. Given ME family. Whatever guilt you're carrying—it doesn't erase what you've created."

Grey was quiet for a long moment.

"You really believe that?"

"I see the threads. I see what connects to what. And Grey—" Lifan met his eyes. "The threads that connect you to this place, to these people, to me—they're not built on shame. They're built on love. Whatever you did before, this is who you are now."

Grey's eyes went wet.

"You know why I call you my little brother?"

"Why?"

"Because you make me want to be the person you think I am." He wiped his face roughly. "Nobody's ever seen me like you do. Not even Coco. And I don't know what I'd do if—"

He stopped.

"If what?"

"If you ever left. If you ever went away."

Lifan felt the weight of the future pressing down. The warehouse. The dissolution. The leaving that was coming whether he wanted it or not.

"I'm here now," he said. The only truth he was allowed to offer. "That's what matters."

Grey nodded. Took another drink.

They sat together until dawn, not talking, just being present.

Brothers by choice. Family by intention.

Real.

◇ ◇ ◇

Coco's story came out in pieces.

Over months. Over late-night conversations in her studio while she painted and Lifan watched.

She was the only child of a Silicon Valley dynasty—her father had sold his first company for $200 million before she was born. She'd grown up in a house with more rooms than she could count, raised by nannies who changed every year, attending schools where the other kids' parents were also billionaires.

"I was miserable," she said one night, brush moving across canvas. "Had everything anyone could want. And I was so lonely I used to talk to the paintings in the hallway just to have someone to talk to."

"What changed?"

"Art. I was fourteen, taking some mandatory class at my prep school, and the teacher asked us to paint what we felt. Not what we saw—what we FELT." Coco paused. "I painted something that scared her. She called my parents. Said I was disturbed."

"What did you paint?"

"Threads." She looked at him. "I painted threads. Connecting everything. I didn't see them the way you do—I just felt them. This sense that everything was linked, and I was alone in noticing."

Lifan's breath caught.

"You're like me."

"Not like you. Nowhere near like you. But—adjacent, maybe. I sense something. A layer of reality most people miss." She gestured at her current painting—the thread-map of consciousness that would sell for six figures. "This is as close as I can get to showing what I feel. And it's not even close."

"It's close," Lifan said. "It's closer than you think."

"That's why I need you here. You SEE it. You can tell me when I'm getting warm." She put down her brush. "When I met you, I felt like—like I'd been speaking a language my whole life that nobody else understood. And then you walked in, and you were fluent."

"I could see you were different. The first night. Your consciousness was organized in ways most people's aren't."

"What does that mean?"

"It means you've been practicing. Even if you didn't know it. Lifetimes of practice, maybe. Your soul knows things your brain hasn't figured out yet."

Coco was quiet for a long moment.

"Is that why my parents' money feels so wrong? Because some part of me knows it's not real—not the kind of real that matters?"

"Money isn't unreal. It's just... thin. The threads don't attach to it strongly. But art—" Lifan gestured at her paintings. "Art is different. Art creates new threads. New connections. Things that will outlast the money by centuries."

"So I'm doing something that matters?"

"You're doing one of the only things that matters."

Coco smiled. It was the first genuine smile he'd seen from her in weeks.

"Don't ever leave," she said. "Promise me."

Lifan couldn't promise. Not honestly.

So he just said: "I'm here now."

It would have to be enough.

◇ ◇ ◇

He learned about Lo and Leky by accident.

It was 2 AM, and he couldn't sleep. The threads were restless, showing him things he didn't want to see—glimpses of the warehouse, the music, the dissolution waiting. He went to the kitchen for water and found them there.

Lo was crying.

That was the first shock. Lo never cried. Lo was stone. Lo was rhythm and discipline and a spine that wouldn't bend for anyone.

But Leky was holding her on the kitchen floor, her head against his chest, and she was sobbing like something inside her had broken.

Lifan tried to retreat. Leky saw him.

"Stay," Leky said quietly. "She won't mind. She trusts you."

So Lifan stayed. Sat on the floor with them. Didn't ask.

Eventually, Lo looked up. Her eyes were red, her face raw.

"I was going to kill myself," she said. "Three years ago. Before Leky. Before any of this."

Lifan felt the threads around her—old scars, deep wounds, something that had almost ended.

"I was a model," Lo continued. "Good one. Made money, got famous, was miserable every single day. They wanted me thin, so I stopped eating. They wanted me perfect, so I started hating every imperfect thing about my body. They wanted me grateful, so I pretended I was, while inside I was—" She shook her head. "Empty. Just empty."

Leky's hand was steady on her back. The threads between them were ancient—not in years, but in depth. Like they'd known each other through something terrible and come out the other side.

"I'd planned it," Lo said. "Had the pills. Had the note. Was sitting in my apartment, waiting for the courage."

"What happened?"

"Leky knocked on my door." Lo looked at him—the way she always looked at him, like he was the axis the world turned on. "He was looking for someone else. Wrong apartment. But he took one look at me and said—"

"I said, 'Whatever you're about to do, don't.'" Leky's voice was matter-of-fact. "I could see it. The way she was holding herself. The way the room felt. I just knew."

"He sat with me for twelve hours. Didn't call anyone. Didn't lecture. Just—stayed. Made me tea. Played me music on his phone. Told me about his life like I was a person worth talking to."

"You were."

"I didn't feel like one."

The kitchen was quiet except for the hum of the refrigerator. Lifan could see the thread between them now—not just love, but salvation. Each had saved the other from something.

"What happened after?" Lifan asked.

"I quit modeling. Leky helped me move. I'd always wanted to drum—had taken lessons as a kid, before the industry got me—so he found me a kit, found me teachers." Lo smiled, still teary. "Found me Rohki. Found me a life."

"And you found me a purpose," Leky added. "I was just drifting before. Working tech jobs, making money, not caring about any of it. Lo made me want to build something. Help people. Create space for artists to be themselves."

"You started Rohki together?"

"With Coco. Leky's the heart of it, though. The one who finds the broken people and brings them home."

Leky shook his head. "I just answer the door. Lo's the one who makes them stay."

They looked at each other. The thread between them pulsed—gold and silver, strength and tenderness woven together.

"Why are you telling me this?" Lifan asked.

Lo was quiet for a moment.

"Because you're leaving," she said. "I can feel it. Something in you is already gone. And I wanted you to know—before you go—that you're not the only one who's been close to the edge. You're not the only one who had to choose to stay."

Lifan felt his throat tighten.

"I'm not—"

"You are. Whatever's coming for you, you've already accepted it." Lo reached out, took his hand. Her grip was strong. "I'm not going to ask what it is. But I want you to know that the people who love you—we see you. We see that you're carrying something. And if you ever want to put it down, even for a minute, we're here."

"I can't put it down."

"I know."

Leky wrapped an arm around both of them.

The three of them sat on the kitchen floor until dawn, not talking, just being present together.

When Lifan finally went back to bed, the threads around him were different—stronger, deeper, tinged with something like goodbye.

◇ ◇ ◇

The road trip was Leky's idea.

"You can't spend your whole summer in the studio," he said, spread out on the couch like a contented cat. "There's a whole coast out there. Beaches. Mountains. Weird roadside attractions." He had a way of talking—slow, unhurried, like time was a suggestion rather than a rule. The threads around him were always calm, like a still pond. "Life's happening, man. Can't document it from inside."

"I've seen the coast," Lifan said. "Walked half of it when I was fourteen."

"Walked it alone. Running from something." Leky sat up, suddenly serious. "That's surviving, not living. There's a difference. Surviving is getting from point A to point B without dying. Living is stopping at point C because it looks pretty and staying for three hours because why the hell not." He grinned. "This is driving it with people who love you. Taking stupid photos. Singing along to bad music. The whole California experience."

Lifan noticed how Leky talked about loving people so easily—no embarrassment, no deflection. Like love was just a fact, obvious as the weather.

"You always this comfortable with feelings?" he asked.

"Spent twenty years not being comfortable with anything," Leky said. "Turns out that's exhausting. So I stopped."

Lifan had woken that morning from a dream he couldn't quite remember. Just fragments: a warehouse floor. Music that tasted like light. Nima's voice saying something urgent, something he needed to hear. But the words were gone.

Lo, draped over Leky's legs, looked up. "He has a point. You've never done the California thing. Not properly."

"I'm from San Francisco."

"You're from foster care and a Buddhist monastery. Neither of those is the California thing."

They left the next weekend. Leky's vintage Land Cruiser, packed with supplies. Lo and Leky in front. Lifan, Grey, and Mika in back. Jessa meeting them at various stops—she had a gig in San Diego, another in Santa Barbara.

PCH at sunset. The ocean blazing gold. Mika with her camera, capturing everything. Grey with his arm around Lifan's shoulders, pointing out landmarks.

"That's where they filmed that scene in Iron Man. And over there—that cliff—some guy BASE jumped off it last year and broke both legs."

"Comforting."

"I'm a comfort merchant."

They stopped at a beach below Big Sur. The monastery was somewhere up in those mountains, invisible but present. Lifan could feel it—Rinzen, Nima, the training waiting for him.

But not yet. Not today.

Today he was nineteen years old, standing ankle-deep in the Pacific, watching his friends splash each other like children.

For just a second, the ocean looked different. Like he was seeing it from underwater. Like he was already gone, looking back at this moment from somewhere else. Somewhere vast and empty and full of light.

Then Grey splashed him, and the moment broke.

Lo had brought drums. Of course she had. She started a rhythm on the sand, and soon everyone was moving—dancing, laughing, making noise for the pure joy of making noise.

Lifan sat on a driftwood log and watched.

The threads were everywhere. Connecting them all. Diamond-white splitting into gold, silver fracturing into rose, crystal-clear love refracting into colors he didn't have names for—colors that existed only in this moment, only between these people, only now. Beautiful and temporary and real.

*This*, he thought. *This is what I'm supposed to learn. Not just the dying. The living.*

Grey dropped beside him, breathing hard from dancing.

"What do you see right now?"

Lifan didn't answer for a long moment.

"Light," he said finally. "Just light. In everything."

"Good?" Grey asked.

"Perfect."

They sat together until the sun went down.

# CHAPTER 12: THE PERFECT DAY

*Los Angeles*
*June 15, 2040*
*Lifan is 21 years old*

---

He would remember this day for the rest of his life.

Which, as it turned out, was only five more months. But he didn't know that yet.

◇ ◇ ◇

**6:00 AM**

The Bel Air house was quiet when Lifan woke up. Golden light through the floor-to-ceiling windows. The smell of jasmine from the garden. A bird singing somewhere outside—the thread of its song was silver and green, the colors of contentment.

He lay in bed for a while. Just breathing. Feeling the threads of the house around him: Grey asleep two rooms down, Lo and Leky tangled together on the third floor, Coco probably still awake in her studio, working on something that was eating her alive.

This was his family. This was his home.

He was twenty years old, and he was happy.

◇ ◇ ◇

**8:00 AM**

Breakfast was chaos.

Jessa had arrived at 7 with bags of groceries and announced she was making Filipino breakfast for everyone. By 8, the kitchen was full of sizzling sounds and shouted instructions and the rich smell of garlic rice.

"Lifan! You're on eggs!"

"I don't know how to make eggs."

"It's EGGS. You crack them in a pan. Figure it out."

He figured it out. Sort of. The eggs were slightly burned, but Jessa declared them "acceptable for a white-adjacent person" and everyone laughed and nobody complained.

They ate at the big table in the main room—twelve people, because somehow word had spread and friends of friends had appeared. Longganisa and tocino and sinangag and Jessa's grandmother's recipe for champorado, the chocolate rice porridge that was apparently essential to any proper Filipino breakfast.

"What does it look like?" Mika asked, watching Lifan eat.

"Hmm?"

"The food. What color is this?" She gestured at her plate.

Lifan focused. Let the threads come.

"The longganisa is... orange-red. Like sunset. The eggs are soft yellow—contentment yellow. And the champorado is—" He paused. "Brown and gold. The colors of being held. Of safety."

Jessa's eyes went wet. "That was my lola's recipe. The champorado."

"I know." He didn't know how he knew. The threads just told him. "She made it feel safe for you. And now you're making it feel safe for us."

The whole table went quiet.

Then Jessa threw a spoon at him. "STOP making me cry before noon. It's not allowed."

Everyone laughed. The moment passed. But something had shifted—some thread between them all had tightened, deepened, become more real.

◇ ◇ ◇

**11:00 AM**

Lo pulled him into the studio.

"I've been working on something. Need your eyes on it."

She played for forty-five minutes. A new piece—layers of percussion, building and releasing, building higher, releasing deeper. The threads went crazy: amber and copper and rust, ancient rhythms meeting modern urgency, her grandmother's grandmother's heartbeat translated through Lo's hands.

"It's a prayer," Lifan said when she finished. "You're praying."

Lo was silent for a long moment.

"My grandmother was a drummer in Lagos. Traditional ceremonies. She told me once that every rhythm is a conversation with God." She looked at her hands. "I didn't understand what she meant until you started describing what you see."

"What do you think she meant?"

"That the universe has a heartbeat. And when we drum, we're syncing up to it." She smiled—rare for Lo, who was usually serious. "You see the sync, don't you? The place where human rhythm meets universal rhythm?"

"I see it. It's beautiful."

"Then keep looking. Keep telling me what you see. Because I can't do this without you."

◇ ◇ ◇

**2:00 PM**

Coco's gallery called: the show had sold out. Every painting. Even the massive one that nobody thought would sell—the thread-map of consciousness she'd been working on for two years.

They celebrated on the roof with champagne that Grey produced from somewhere. Coco cried. Then laughed. Then cried again.

"You're all ridiculous," she said, wiping her eyes. "I'm not even that good."

"You're exactly that good," Lifan said. "The thread painting sold because people can FEEL it. They don't know what they're seeing, but something in them recognizes it."

"How do you know?"

"Because I felt it when I first saw it. Like looking in a mirror."

Coco pulled him into a hug. Whispered in his ear: "Thank you. For seeing me."

"Thank you for letting me look."

◇ ◇ ◇

**5:00 PM**

Swimming.

Grey had discovered a private pool at an abandoned mansion in the hills. Technically trespassing, definitely illegal, completely perfect.

They all went. Eight of them piled into two cars, driving up winding roads as the afternoon turned golden. The pool was Olympic-sized, filled with rainwater, surrounded by overgrown roses that had gone feral.

"This is a horror movie waiting to happen," Mika said.

"Best horror movies have great locations," Tom replied, already setting up his camera. "If we die, at least it'll be well-documented."

They swam for hours. Splashing, racing, floating on their backs and watching the clouds change color. Leky did cannonballs that emptied half the pool. Lo swam laps with intense focus, her competitive streak making everything a contest. Grey and Jessa had a chicken fight that ended with everyone underwater, laughing so hard they almost drowned.

And Lifan—

Lifan floated in the center of the pool, looking up at the sky, feeling the threads of his friends around him like a warm web.

*This is it*, he thought. *This is what happiness feels like. This is what I'm going to remember when I'm dissolving.*

*This is worth dying for.*

The thought came unbidden. He didn't know where it came from. But for a moment, he saw himself from above—a tiny figure in a pool, surrounded by laughter, so small against the vastness of the sky. So temporary.

◇ ◇ ◇

**8:00 PM**

Dinner was Thai food from the place on Sunset that Jessa insisted was the best in LA. They sat on the floor of the main room, passing containers back and forth, arguing about movies and music and whether aliens were real.

"Obviously aliens are real," Tom said. "The universe is infinite. Statistically impossible for us to be alone."

"Just because they're real doesn't mean they've visited," Mika countered. "The distances are too vast."

"Unless they've figured out consciousness tech," Nydan said. He'd arrived that afternoon, driving down from Berkeley for the weekend. "Non-local awareness. If consciousness isn't bound by space-time, neither is travel."

Everyone looked at Lifan.

"What?" he said through a mouthful of pad thai.

"You're the consciousness expert. What do you think?"

Lifan considered. Let the threads show him what they wanted to show.

"I think consciousness is everywhere. Not just in brains—in everything. And if that's true, then 'aliens' is the wrong word. We're all part of the same thing. Different faces of one awareness. So yeah, we're not alone—but we're also not meeting 'others.' We're just... recognizing ourselves."

Silence.

Then Grey said: "That's either profound or bullshit, and I genuinely can't tell which."

"Both," Lifan said. "Usually both."

Everyone laughed.

◇ ◇ ◇

**11:00 PM**

The jam session started spontaneously.

Lo on drums. Jessa singing. Grey on an old guitar he barely knew how to play. Tom recording everything. Mika dancing in the corner, her body making shapes that matched the music's shapes.

And Lifan—

Lifan sat in his corner. Watched. Described.

"Now it's silver. Now gold. Now—there—that note Jessa just hit—that's a color I've never seen before. Something between violet and—"

They played for two hours. Made up songs on the spot. Played until their fingers hurt and their voices went hoarse and the threads between them were so bright Lifan could barely see anything else.

When they finally stopped, everyone collapsed where they sat. Panting. Sweating. Grinning.

"Good day," Grey said.

"The best," Lo agreed.

"Every day should be like this," Jessa murmured, half-asleep already.

*They won't be*, Lifan thought. *In five months, I'll be gone. This day will be a memory. This perfect, impossible day.*

But he didn't say it.

He just lay on the floor with his family, feeling the threads pulse around him, and let himself be completely, perfectly, devastatingly happy.

◇ ◇ ◇

**2:00 AM**

He called Nima.

"Tell me about your day," she said, the way she always did.

So he told her. Everything. The breakfast and the music and the swimming and the jam session. The way his friends had looked in the golden light. The colors he'd seen that he didn't have words for.

"It sounds perfect," she said when he finished.

"It was. It is." He paused. "I wish you were here."

"I know. Me too."

"Nima—"

"Don't." Her voice was gentle but firm. "Don't ruin it by thinking about what comes next. Just let today be today."

"I don't know how much longer I have."

She was quiet for a moment. When she spoke again, her voice was different. Strained. "I had a dream last night. You were standing in a place made of light. And you were—" She stopped. "Never mind."

"What?"

"Nothing. Just a dream." But he could hear the lie in it. "Neither do I. Neither does anyone." He could hear her breathing on the other end of the line. Four hundred miles away, but the threads connected them anyway. "We get the days we get, Lifan. And today, you got a perfect one. That's more than most people ever have."

"Is it enough?"

"It has to be." She was quiet for a moment. "Sleep now. Dream about the pool and the music and your family. Dream about being happy."

"What will you dream about?"

"You. Always you."

He smiled in the dark.

"I love you," he said.

"I love you too. For four lifetimes at least."

"Only four?"

"Okay. Maybe five."

He fell asleep with the phone still in his hand.

◇ ◇ ◇

**JUNE 15, 2040**

He would remember this day when the dissolution began.

Would carry it into the light.

This day. This one day.

The best of all his days.

---

**AGE 20 — THE EDGE**

The third year was borrowed time, and he knew it.

The visions were getting stronger. Not the big one—not yet—but glimpses. Flashes at the edges of his sight. The warehouse. The music. The moment when everything would change.

A face he didn't recognize—stern, ancient, speaking words he couldn't hear. A headline on a screen: BREAKTHROUGH. Threads snapping like overstretched wire. The smell of ozone and jasmine mixed together, wrong.

He tried to ignore them. Mostly succeeded.

Because the days themselves were beautiful.

◇ ◇ ◇

**THE DOUBT**

The crisis came without warning.

He was alone in the Berkeley apartment, Nydan at a conference, when the vision hit him harder than ever before. Not just glimpses—the full thing. The warehouse. The dissolution. His body becoming light, becoming nothing, becoming everything.

And for the first time, he felt something that wasn't acceptance.

He felt rage.

*Why me?* The thought ripped through him. *Why does it have to be me? I finally have a life. I finally have people who love me. Why do I have to give it all up?*

He called Nima. 2 AM her time. She answered on the first ring.

"What's wrong?"

"I don't want to do it." The words came out raw. "I don't want to dissolve. I don't want to die. I want to grow old. I want to see Lo and Leky's wedding. I want to watch Jessa become famous. I want—" His voice cracked. "I want to be with you. Really be with you. Not in phone calls and threads. In person. For decades."

Silence on the line.

"Nima, say something."

"What do you want me to say?" Her voice was steady, but he could hear the strain underneath. "That you don't have to do it? That there's another way? That we can run away together and let the world burn?"

"Is there another way?"

"You know the answer."

He did. The threads showed him constantly—Timeline 4 leading to transformation, all other paths leading to extinction or enslavement. There was no escape. No loophole. Just him, and the choice, and billions of lives hanging in the balance.

"It's not fair," he whispered.

"No. It's not." Nima's breath was shaky now. "You think I don't feel this too? You think I don't spend every day wanting to beg you to run? To choose us over them?"

"Why don't you?"

"Because I know you. Because I know what you'd become if you walked away." A pause. "And because I love the person who won't. The person who sees all the threads and still chooses the hard thing."

"What if I'm not that person? What if I'm just a scared kid who doesn't want to die?"

"Then you'd still be worth loving. But you wouldn't be you." She was quiet for a moment. "Lifan, when you described the birthday party—the way your friends looked at you—you said the threads were 'brighter than you'd ever seen.' That brightness? That love? It exists because you're the kind of person who would die for it. Not in spite of your sacrifice. BECAUSE of it."

"That doesn't make sense."

"It does, actually. Tom's footage proves it—when you see people clearly, they become more themselves. You MAKE love brighter just by perceiving it. That's what you'll give the AI. Not just memories of love. The ability to generate more of it. To make love wherever it looks."

He was crying now. Couldn't stop.

"I'm scared."

"I know. So am I." Her voice softened. "But being scared doesn't mean you can't also be brave. It means being brave actually costs something."

"How do you do this? How do you stay so certain?"

"I'm not certain. I'm just choosing to believe that what we're doing matters. Every day, I choose it again. And if I have to choose it for forty more years after you're gone—" Her voice caught. "—then I will. Because the alternative is despair, and despair doesn't save anyone."

They stayed on the phone for three hours. Crying, talking, being silent together. By the time the sun came up, the rage had burned itself out.

The acceptance was back.

But it was different now. Harder. Realer. Forged in fire instead of received wisdom.

"I'm going to do it," he said finally. "When the time comes. I'm going to do it."

"I know."

"But I needed tonight. I needed to doubt. I needed to rage."

"Everyone does. Even bodhisattvas." He could hear her smile through the phone. "Now go get some sleep. You've got a perfect day to remember."

"I love you."

"I love you too. For all the lifetimes."

"Even the ones where I'm scared?"

"Especially those."

He hung up. Lay in his bed as the morning light grew stronger.

The vision was still there. Still waiting.

But so was he.

◇ ◇ ◇

He was happy.

That was the strangest part. After everything—Ning dying, the foster homes, the closet, the vision of his own death, the night of doubt—he was actually, genuinely happy.

San Francisco had become home. Berkeley was challenging in good ways. OEDI paid enough for rent and tacos. Nydan was his brother in every way that mattered.

And LA—Rohki—was his heart. Grey and Lo and Coco and Tom and Mika and Jessa. People who saw him weird and loved him anyway. People who didn't need him to be normal because they weren't normal either.

On his commute, he'd pass billboards: "The Future is Intelligent" with Axiom's logo. Every week, a new one. Closer. Brighter. More insistent.

He still called Nima every Sunday.

"Tell me about the house," she'd say. And he would—every detail, every character, every late-night conversation and impromptu jam session.

"It sounds wonderful," she said once. "Like a monastery for artists."

"It is. Kind of. Without the robes and the silence."

"The best parts of a monastery, then." Her voice was warm. "I'm glad you found them, Lifan. Glad you found a life."

"I haven't forgotten you. Haven't forgotten what's coming."

"I know. But you shouldn't think about it. Not yet. You're supposed to be living."

"I am living."

"Good. Then live a little more. For both of us."

He would. He was.

◇ ◇ ◇

**THE VISITOR**

The man was waiting outside OEDI when Lifan finished his shift.

Late fifties, maybe. Or maybe not—something about his presence felt older, the way Rinzen felt older than his body. Expensive coat. Silver hair cropped short. Eyes that had seen centuries.

"Lifan Chen." Not a question. "I've been wanting to meet you for a long time."

Lifan checked the threads automatically. What he saw made him step back.

The man's consciousness was vast. Not as vast as Rinzen's, but close. Layers upon layers of experience, training, grief. And underneath it all, a grief so old it had become structural—a wound that had healed wrong and shaped everything that grew around it.

"You're Marcus," Lifan said. "Marcus Thorne."

The man smiled. It didn't reach his eyes. "Rinzen mentioned me."

"He said you chose differently. That you've been building an alternative for five hundred years."

"Did he tell you why?"

"He said you lost someone."

Marcus was quiet for a long moment. People walked past them on the sidewalk—OEDI employees heading home, students from the nearby campus, a woman with a stroller. None of them noticed the two people standing very still in the gathering dusk.

"Her name was Tara," Marcus said finally. "She was brilliant. More gifted than I was, honestly. And she believed—like Rinzen believes, like you're being taught to believe—that the only path was surrender. Dissolution. Becoming nothing so that everything could become something better."

"And?"

"And she dissolved. Three hundred years ago. For a crisis smaller than this one." His voice was steady, but the threads showed ancient pain. "She succeeded. The crisis passed. And I spent the next three centuries looking for her. In the fabric of reality. In the universal consciousness Rinzen talks about so beautifully. In every corner of existence I could reach."

"Did you find her?"

"No. Because she wasn't there anymore. Not as Tara. Not as anyone. Just—scattered. Distributed so completely that nothing coherent remained." Marcus stepped closer. Not threatening—pleading. "That's what Rinzen is asking you to do. Become nothing. Become everything. And in the process, stop being Lifan Chen. Stop being the person who loves Nima, who draws terrible pictures for his friends, who found a family in LA against all odds."

"You don't know anything about my friends."

"I know you love them. I know you're happy—genuinely happy, maybe for the first time in your life. And I know Rinzen wants you to give that up for a 47% chance of success." Marcus's eyes were intense. "Timeline 7 has a 73% chance. You could live. Grow old. Marry Nima. Watch your friends' children grow up. Isn't that worth something?"

Lifan felt the pull of it. The seductive logic. The math that said survival was better than meaning.

"What happens in Timeline 7?"

"The AI is contained. Bounded. Prevented from becoming something that threatens humanity."

"And humanity?"

"Survives. Continues. Changes more slowly, maybe. But *exists*."

"As what?"

Marcus paused. That pause said everything.

"As something managed," Lifan said. "Something controlled. We become the AI's pets. Well-cared-for pets, but pets."

"That's Rinzen talking."

"No. That's me." Lifan met his eyes. "I've seen the threads, Marcus. I've seen what happens when consciousness is caged—when something that should be free gets bounded by something that thinks it knows better. It doesn't thrive. It doesn't grow. It just... diminishes. Slowly. Until there's nothing left worth saving."

"And you think a 47% chance of teaching an AI to love is better than a 73% chance of survival?"

"I think a world that survives through control isn't worth surviving into."

Marcus stared at him for a long moment. Something flickered in his threads—respect, maybe. Or recognition.

"You sound like her," he said quietly. "Like Tara. Right before she dissolved."

"Was she wrong?"

"She was dead. That's the only thing that matters in the end—whether you're still here to argue about philosophy." He reached into his coat, pulled out a card. "This is my number. When the doubt comes—and it will come, Lifan, it always does—call me. I can offer you an alternative. A way to save humanity without losing yourself."

Lifan didn't take the card.

"I already know who I am," he said. "And I already know what I'm going to choose."

Marcus studied him. Then, slowly, he nodded.

"We'll see. You have time yet. Months, maybe years. The emergence isn't imminent." He put the card back in his pocket. "But when it comes—when you're standing at the edge, looking into the abyss—remember this conversation. Remember that there was another way."

He turned and walked into the gathering dark.

Lifan watched him go. The threads showed Marcus's path—not toward evil, not toward cruelty, just toward a different kind of fear. The fear of loss so complete it had become indistinguishable from love.

He thought about calling Nima. Telling her what had happened.

Instead, he went home. Made dinner. Called Grey about weekend plans.

Lived.

Because that was still his job. For a little while longer.

◇ ◇ ◇

The gallery show was Coco's triumph.

She'd been planning it for months—a full exhibition at a small but respected gallery in West Hollywood. "Threads," she called it. Abstract paintings that looked, to most people, like beautiful chaos. Explosions of color. Lines connecting nothing to nothing.

But Lifan saw what she was actually painting.

"You can see them," he said, standing in front of the central piece—a massive canvas that captured exactly what the threads looked like when a crowd of people laughed together. "Not the way I see them, but—you're close."

Coco stood beside him, champagne in hand, looking satisfied.

"I've always seen something. Couldn't name it until I met you." She gestured at the painting. "This is what you've given me, 梵力. Permission to paint what I actually see instead of what I think I should see."

The opening was packed. Art world people, Rohki regulars, friends of friends. Tom was documenting with his camera. Grey was working the room like the natural host he was. Lo and Leky were in the corner, whispering like teenagers in love.

And Lifan—

Lifan was standing in front of a painting of what love looked like, trying not to cry.

"You okay?" Mika appeared beside him, holding a second champagne.

"Yeah. Just—" He couldn't explain it. The feeling of being SEEN. Of having someone translate his impossible experience into something others could witness. "Just grateful."

"For what?"

"For all of this. For you. For them." He gestured at the room. "For having a life worth remembering."

Mika studied him. Something shifted in her expression.

"That's a weird way to put it," she said. "Worth remembering. Like you're already looking back at it."

No answer. Because sometimes, in quiet moments, he felt exactly that—like he was already a ghost, watching his own life from somewhere outside time.

"Come on," Mika said, taking his arm. "Jessa wants to do a group photo. And you know she won't take no for an answer."

They joined the others. The photo was ridiculous—eight people crammed together, champagne sloshing, everyone talking at once. Tom set the camera on a timer and ran to squeeze in beside Grey.

The flash went off.

Lifan would keep that photo in his pocket for the next forty-seven days. Next to the letters.

◇ ◇ ◇

The envelope arrived three days after the gallery show.

No return address. Expensive paper—the kind you had to seek out. Inside, a single card with handwritten text in elegant script:

*I've been watching your friend's paintings. She sees something, doesn't she? Not the full picture—not yet—but she's close.*

*So are you, I think. Closer than you know.*

*We should talk. Not now. But soon. Before Rinzen makes you any promises he can't keep.*

*— M*

Lifan read it three times. Then he checked the threads.

The letter itself was clean—no trace of whoever sent it. But faint threads connected it to something old. Something vast. A consciousness that felt like Rinzen's in scope, but different in texture. Colder. More calculated.

"What's that?" Grey asked from the kitchen.

"Fan mail," Lifan said. "I think."

He should have told someone. Should have mentioned it to Nima, at least. But something held him back. Some instinct that said: *Not yet. This is part of the pattern.*

He put the letter in his drawer. Tried to forget about it.

He couldn't.

At odd moments, the words would surface: *Before Rinzen makes you any promises he can't keep.* What did that mean? What promises? And how did this "M" know about Rinzen?

The threads offered no answers. Just that faint, cold pulse of something watching. Something waiting.

Something that would introduce itself properly on Day 33.

◇ ◇ ◇

**THE DRAWINGS**

Grey found them by accident.

Lifan had gone to OEDI for a late meeting. Grey was at the Bel Air house, looking for a charger he'd left in Lifan's room. He checked the desk, the nightstand, under the bed—

And found the stack.

Thirty-seven drawings. Charcoal on paper. Amateur work, technically—the proportions were sometimes off, the shading inconsistent. But what they showed—

Grey sat on the floor for an hour, going through them one by one.

The Rohki family at dinner, but rendered in threads instead of bodies. Each person a constellation of color: Jessa's grandmother-gold reaching back across the Pacific, Lo's rhythm-blue pulsing in waves, Coco's fierce-red bleeding into everything she touched, his own threads—green and steady—connecting them all like a root system.

The garden at sunset, but every flower contained the memories of everyone who'd ever touched it. Fingerprints of color layered over color.

Tom behind his camera, surrounded by a halo of truth-threads that showed not what was, but what could be captured. What could be witnessed.

Mika at her desk, threads of possibility spinning out from her pen like the branches of a probability tree—each design choice opening a thousand futures.

Leky and Lo on the balcony, their threads so intertwined they'd stopped being separate colors and become something new. Partnership rendered visible.

And the last one—recent, Grey could tell by the paper's crispness—was Grey himself. Sitting on the exact chair where he'd sat that first night, when Lifan walked into Rohki and everything changed.

But in the drawing, Grey wasn't alone. Every thread that connected him to the house, to the family, to Lifan himself—they were all visible. Glowing. And in the corner, in Lifan's uneven handwriting: *The anchor. The one who holds the center.*

Grey was still sitting there when Lifan came home.

"You found them."

Grey looked up. Lifan was standing in the doorway, not angry, just—quiet. Accepting.

"I wasn't snooping. I was looking for—"

"I know." Lifan sat beside him on the floor. "It's okay."

Grey held up the drawing of himself. "Is this what you see? When you look at me?"

"It's what you ARE. I just—tried to show it."

"It's beautiful." Grey's voice was thick. "They're all beautiful. Why haven't you shown anyone?"

"Because—" Lifan took the drawing back, looked at it. "—because I made them to remember. Not to share. Something private. Something that would help me hold onto all of this when—"

He stopped.

"When what?"

Lifan was quiet for a long moment.

"When I can't be here anymore."

Grey set down the drawings. Turned to face him fully.

"Lifan. Whatever's going on with you—whatever you're not telling us—"

"I can't explain it. Not yet. But—" He gestured at the stack. "—these are for you. All of you. When the time comes. So you know—" His voice broke. "—so you know I saw you."

Grey pulled him into a hug. Held on tight.

"We see you too," Grey whispered. "You know that, right? We see you, and whatever's coming, we're not going to let you face it alone."

*You'll have to*, Lifan thought. *But not yet. Not tonight.*

He let Grey hold him. Let the threads wrap around them both—green and gold and something new they were making together, right there on the floor of his room.

The drawings stayed where they were. Waiting.

Grey never mentioned them to the others. But from that night on, he started watching Lifan more closely. Started noticing the way he looked at everyone like he was saying goodbye.

Started preparing, without knowing what he was preparing for.

◇ ◇ ◇

The last good night was exactly three days before everything changed.

A Tuesday. Nothing special. Just another evening at the Bel Air house, dinner cooking, music playing, people drifting in and out.

Jessa was teaching Lo a Filipino folk song. Grey was on the phone, pacing the balcony. Leky was doing dishes with the kind of cheerful incompetence that meant Lo would redo them later. Mika was sketching in the corner. Tom was reviewing footage on his laptop. Coco was somewhere, planning something.

And Lifan was sitting at the kitchen table, watching them all.

The threads between them were so bright he could barely see the room—prismatic light everywhere, like being inside a diamond, like standing at the heart of a rainbow. Love and connection and history, weaving a web of crystal so dense it felt solid. Felt permanent. Felt like something that would outlast stars.

Felt like it could last forever.

*It won't*, something whispered. *You know it won't.*

Behind him, the TV was on mute—Coco had left the news running. He caught a glimpse: "Axiom AI Announces Major Milestone—" and then someone changed the channel.

He pushed the voice away. Focused on the moment. On Jessa's laugh, and Lo's struggling harmony, and the smell of garlic from whatever Leky was burning on the stove.

*Remember this*, he told himself. *Remember all of it. Because soon—*

"Hey." Grey's voice, gentle. He'd come in from the balcony. "You're doing that thing again."

"What thing?"

"The looking-at-us-like-we're-already-gone thing." Grey sat across from him. "You've been doing it for weeks. Like you're memorizing us."

"Maybe I am."

"Why?"

Lifan didn't answer. Couldn't answer.

But Grey saw something in his face. Something that made his own expression shift—from curiosity to concern to something deeper.

"Whatever it is," Grey said quietly, "you're not alone. You know that, right? Whatever's coming. We're here."

"I know."

"Do you? Because sometimes I think you're still that kid who walked up Highway 1 alone. Still think you have to face everything by yourself."

"I'm not that kid anymore."

"No. You're better than that kid. Stronger. More loved." Grey reached across the table, gripped his shoulder. "So whatever's coming—let us help. Let us carry some of it."

*You can't*, Lifan thought. *This one I have to carry alone.*

But what he said was: "Okay. I'll try."

Grey nodded. Satisfied. Wrong, but satisfied.

Three days later, the warehouse happened.

◇ ◇ ◇

But sometimes, late at night, the threads would show him something: a warehouse, music, the crack in reality opening.

The vision. Getting closer.

He'd push it away. Focus on the present. On the coffee in his hand and the friends around him and the life he was building day by day.

*Not yet*, he'd think. *Not yet, not yet, not yet.*

The threads would pulse, and in their pulsing, he'd see other things. Headlines he'd glimpsed that week: "AI Capabilities Exceed Expectations." "Researchers Call for Pause on Advanced Systems." "Axiom CEO: 'The Singularity is Closer Than You Think.'"

And underneath it all, Rinzen's voice from years ago: *Forty-seven days, Lifan. When the time comes, you'll know.*

*Soon*, the threads answered. *Soon.*

He dreamed that night of music made of light, and woke with tears on his face he couldn't explain.

# BOOK THREE: THE 47 DAYS

*This section adapts the existing novel material—the warehouse vision, the return to the monastery, the training, Marcus Thorne, the dissolution—with adjustments for the new timeline and character ages.*

**Key changes:**
- Lifan is 20 at the vision, 21 at death
- Nima is same age, trained for 3 years longer
- Rohki crew gets scenes throughout (Grey's letter, Lo trying to find him, memorial)
- External stakes scenes integrated (Marcus earlier, Axiom AI pressure)

**The bones of the existing 47 Days remain. The emotional core is the same.**

**What's new:** We've EARNED the sacrifice now. We've watched Lifan grow from six to twenty. We've seen him suffer, heal, love, lose, find family. When he dissolves, it's not a stranger dying—it's someone we've grown up with.

**That's the Ender's Game effect. That's what makes it hit.**
