# THE BIRTHDAY PARTY

*Bel Air, Los Angeles*
*October 2038*
*Lifan turns 18*

---

They blindfolded him at the door.

"This is ridiculous," Lifan said.

"This is *love*," Jessa corrected, tying the knot behind his head. "Shut up and walk."

He couldn't see anything. Just dark fabric and the smell of Jessa's perfume—something floral and expensive that Mika had probably forced on her. Hands on his shoulders, guiding him forward. He could hear the house: music playing, voices, footsteps. More people than usual.

"If this is a prank—"

"It's not a prank." That was Grey, somewhere to his left. "Trust us."

*Trust us.* Two words he'd never heard in eighteen years of foster homes and social workers and adults who promised to stay and then didn't. Two words that still felt foreign in his mouth, even after a year of Rohki showing him what they meant.

He walked. One step. Five. Ten.

The music got louder. Something Lo had been working on—he recognized her rhythm even blindfolded. And underneath it, voices. Whispering. Hushing each other.

"Okay," Jessa said. "Stop."

He stopped.

"Ready?"

"I don't know what I'm supposed to be ready for—"

She pulled off the blindfold.

◇ ◇ ◇

The main room was packed.

Forty people. Maybe more. Everyone from Rohki—Lo, Leky, Coco, Tom, Mika—plus people he'd met once at jam sessions and people he'd never seen before and people who were crying already even though nothing had happened yet.

And in the center of the room:

A cake.

Not just a cake. A *sculpture*. Shaped like a loom—wooden frame and threads and shuttle—but made of frosting and spun sugar and something that caught the light like actual crystal. Rainbow threads connecting every tier, each one refracting the candlelight into a thousand tiny spectrums across the walls and ceiling.

"Mika designed it," Grey said softly, beside him. "Lo baked it. Badly. Coco bought a backup from an actual bakery."

"I can *hear* you," Lo called from somewhere in the crowd.

Lifan couldn't breathe.

He was looking at the threads—the real ones, not the frosting—and they were *blazing*. Brighter than he'd ever seen. Every person in this room connected to every other person, and all of them connected to him. A web so dense and crystalline it was almost solid.

*They did this for me*, he thought. *All of this. For me.*

"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU—"

Jessa started it. Off-key on purpose, because she thought perfect pitch was boring. And then everyone joined in—the worst rendition of Happy Birthday in human history, fifty people singing at different speeds and different keys and different levels of sobriety.

"HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR LIFAN—"

His name. Fifty people saying his name.

"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOOOOOU!"

The song ended. The room went quiet. Fifty faces looking at him, waiting.

And Lifan—

Lifan cried.

◇ ◇ ◇

**GREY**

Watching Lifan cry was like watching a dam break.

Not dramatic. Not loud. Just—water, pouring out of him, like he'd been holding it back for eighteen years and finally ran out of strength.

Grey caught him before he could collapse. Pulled him into a hug that turned into a group hug that turned into a pile of bodies on the floor, everyone laughing and crying and saying things that didn't make sense.

"You're okay," Grey murmured into Lifan's hair. "You're okay, little brother. Let it out."

"I don't—" Lifan's voice was wrecked. "I've never—"

"I know."

"Nobody's ever—"

"I *know*."

Grey held him tighter. Around them, the Rohki family did the same—Lo's hand on Lifan's back, Jessa's arms around both of them, Coco somewhere in the pile whispering "let it out, baby, let it all out."

This was what family was supposed to be. Not the bullshit Grey had grown up with—not the foster homes or the group homes or the adults who gave up. This. Bodies pressed together. Hearts beating in sync. A room full of people who would burn down the world for each other.

*This is what we're giving him*, Grey thought. *This is what he's never had.*

It wasn't enough to make up for eighteen years of nothing. But it was a start.

◇ ◇ ◇

**LO**

The speeches started at midnight.

Coco went first, standing on a chair because she was five-two and couldn't see over anyone's head.

"When I started Rohki, I thought I was building a place for artists. Turns out I was building a place for weirdos." She raised her glass. "And then this weirdo showed up—" pointing at Lifan "—and he was weirder than all of us combined. And somehow that made everything make sense."

Lifan was still crying. Hadn't stopped for an hour. Lo had never seen anyone cry that much without dehydrating.

"To Lifan," Coco said. "The weirdest, best person I've ever met."

"TO LIFAN!"

Glasses clinked. Lifan tried to hide behind Grey. Failed.

Tom went next. "Lifan sees what we're trying to express. He translates the untranslatable. That's not perception—that's love. The willingness to really look at someone else's inner world."

Leky: "What Lo's trying to say—" because Lo was crying too hard to speak "—is that you see her. You see all of us. And we see you."

Mika just touched the collar of Lifan's jacket—the iridescent one she'd made him—and smiled. "You finally look like yourself."

And Grey: "Little brother. That's it. That's the whole thing."

Lo watched Lifan receive each speech like a body blow. Watched him try to deflect, minimize, make himself smaller. Watched him fail, because Rohki didn't let you be small.

*This is the first time anyone's ever celebrated him*, she realized. *Eighteen years. And this is the first time.*

Something broke in her chest. Something that had been healing since she left modeling and found Rohki and learned that her body was for creating, not displaying.

She grabbed her drumsticks.

"Okay," she said. "My turn."

The room went quiet.

Lo started playing.

Not a speech. A rhythm. The one she'd been working on since Lifan described her grandmother's music—since he'd seen something in her playing that she'd almost forgotten was there.

She played for three minutes. Four. Five. No words. Just drums. Just the beat of a heart that had finally found its people.

When she stopped, nobody spoke.

Then Jessa started singing.

◇ ◇ ◇

**JESSA**

She'd written the song that afternoon.

"Thread-Sight Boy," she called it. About a kid who could see what nobody else could see. Who spent years hiding. Who finally found people strange enough to love him.

*You see the colors that we can't see*
*You hold the patterns that set us free*
*And every thread leads back to you*
*Thread-sight boy, we see you too*

Her voice spiraled through the room. Gold and violet, if Lifan was seeing it. She wondered what her grandmother's songs looked like to him—the lullabies she'd learned in Manila, the recipes sung instead of written.

*You thought you were alone*
*You thought you were a ghost*
*But the ones who see the most*
*Are the ones who need love most*

By the second chorus, everyone was crying.

Not just Lifan. *Everyone*. Grey with his jaw clenched, trying to hold it together. Lo with mascara running down her face. Coco ugly-crying into Leky's shoulder. Tom—Tom who never showed emotion—wiping his glasses on his shirt.

*Thread-sight boy, we see you*
*Thread-sight boy, we need you*
*Thread-sight boy, you're home*
*You're finally home*

When the song ended, the room was silent.

Then Lifan said, in a voice that was barely there: "I hate you all. This is too much."

And everyone laughed. And everyone cried harder. And Jessa grabbed him and held on until he stopped shaking.

"Get used to it," she whispered. "This is what family does. We overwhelm you with love until you can't pretend to be okay anymore."

◇ ◇ ◇

**LIFAN**

At 3 AM, they ended up on the roof.

Grey. Lo. Leky. Coco. Mika. Jessa. Tom. Nydan. Lifan.

The city sparkled below them. The air was cool. Someone had brought whiskey. Lifan's throat was raw from crying.

"Birthday game," Jessa said. "Everyone says one true thing about Lifan. Something you've never said out loud."

Groans. Protests. But nobody left.

Lo went first: "When you described my drumming as 'amber waves'—I went home and cried. Nobody had ever made my music feel important before."

Leky: "You're the only person Lo talks about when I'm not around."

Mika touched his jacket again. No words. None needed.

Grey: "Little brother. That's it. That's the whole thing."

Nydan: "You see things that would break most people. And you just—keep going."

Coco: "I built this place for people like you. And then you showed up, and I realized I'd been waiting my whole life to meet you."

Tom: "I'm making a documentary. About you. About all of us. Because someday people are going to want to know what happened here. What you built with us."

Jessa: "You make me feel like my singing matters. Not in a performance way. In a *truth* way. And I've never had that before."

Lifan sat in the silence that followed.

The threads between them were blazing—brighter than he'd ever seen. A cathedral of light. A web of love so dense it was almost solid.

"I don't deserve this," he whispered.

"Nobody deserves love," Grey said. "That's what makes it love. You can't earn it. Can't buy it. It just is."

"And it's yours," Coco added. "Whether you think you deserve it or not."

Lifan looked at these people—this impossible family he'd stumbled into. These beautiful, broken artists who'd decided he belonged with them.

*I have to leave you*, he thought, the knowledge rising unbidden. Something Rinzen had told him. Something about a vision. A choice. A death.

*In a few years, I have to leave you all behind.*

But not tonight.

Tonight, he was eighteen years old. Tonight, he had a family. Tonight, he was loved.

That would have to be enough.

◇ ◇ ◇

"Make a wish," Coco said softly.

The cake was half-demolished, but eighteen candles still burned in the remains. Lifan looked at them—at the light catching the crystal sugar, at the rainbows scattered across the walls.

*I wish this could last forever.*

He knew it couldn't. He knew what was coming. But right now, in this moment, with these people—

He closed his eyes.

And blew out the candles.
