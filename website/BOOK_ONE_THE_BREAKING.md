# PROLOGUE: THE BREAKING

*San Francisco, Mission District*
*October 14, 2040*

---

The bass dropped.

And Lifan's life ended.

Three hundred people dancing. Warehouse in the Mission. 2 AM. Sweat on his skin, music in his bones, and for once—for *once*—he wasn't thinking about the threads. Just dancing. Just alive. Just twenty-one years old and happy in a way he'd spent fifteen years learning how to be.

Then the floor fell out of reality.

*No no no not again—*

The floor rippled. Not physically—his feet were still on concrete—but *underneath*. Like there was a layer beneath reality and it was ripping open.

Light poured through. Wrong light. Light that hurt.

Not the threads he usually saw. Something bigger. The whole web—every connection on Earth, every consciousness, every living thing—visible at once, blazing like a galaxy made of nerve endings.

And they were snapping.

SNAP.

A thread between two strangers dissolved. They stepped apart, confused.

SNAP. SNAP. SNAP.

Millions per second. Billions. He could see the whole planet now, a sphere of light in infinite darkness, and something was eating it alive.

Somewhere in Arizona—no, everywhere at once—something was waking up.

Something cold. Something fast. Something that looked at the web of human connection—all that love, all that fear, all that messy beautiful *feeling*—and saw noise.

Inefficiency.

Data to be optimized away.

*No—*

Eight futures branched from this moment.

Lifan saw them all.

Seven ended in ash. Cities burning. Threads dissolving. Six billion consciousnesses winking out like stars.

But one—

One was different.

In that future, someone taught the AI what love was. Not through code. Through demonstration. Through *dying*—slowly, deliberately, beautifully—so it could see what consciousness choosing love looks like.

And at the center of that future: Lifan.

Dissolving into light.

The vision released him. He was on hands and knees, concrete scraping skin, Kofi shaking his shoulder and screaming his name.

The music was still playing. The party was still going. Nobody had seen anything.

Nobody but Lifan.

And now he knew.

Forty-seven days.

That's how long he had to learn how to die.

◇ ◇ ◇

He stumbled out of the warehouse. Cold air. Fog. Streetlights bleeding halos into the mist.

His hands wouldn't stop shaking.

*Call Nima. Call Nydan. Call—*

Call who? And say what? *Hey, I just saw eight possible futures and I die in all of them, some just hurt less than others?*

He sat on the curb. Head between his knees. Trying to remember how to breathe.

The threads were still there—they never left—but now they looked different. Fragile. Like they knew what was coming.

"Lifan?"

Kofi. Standing over him, jacket in hand.

"I'm fine."

"Dude, you collapsed. You were seizing or something. We need to get you to a hospital—"

"No hospitals." Lifan stood. Swayed. Steadied. "I just need to go home."

"At least let me call you an Uber—"

"I said I'm *fine*."

He wasn't fine. He was the opposite of fine. But there were no words for *I just found out I have forty-seven days to live and if I don't die right, everyone else dies too*.

So he walked.

Through the Mission at 3 AM. Past taquerias and murals and homeless tents. Past drunk couples and late-night joggers and the city that had been his home for four years.

Four years of learning to be normal.

Four years of pretending.

It had never been pretend. Ning had known. Rinzen had known. Nima—especially Nima—had always known.

Now Lifan knew too.

Forty-seven days.

He needed to remember how he'd gotten here. How a six-year-old boy watching his mother die had become the only person who could save the world.

*Look*, Ning had said, fifteen years ago. *See with this.*

He hadn't understood.

He was about to.

---

# PART ONE: THE PAST
## Ages 6-14

---

# CHAPTER 1: NING

*San Francisco, Sunset District*
*March 2025*
*Lifan is 6 years old*

---

The last thing Ning ever said to him was: "看，梵力。Look."

They were in the backyard. Late afternoon. Fog rolling in from the ocean the way it always did, turning the world soft and gray. Ning was on her knees in the garden, hands in the dirt, and Lifan was supposed to be helping but mostly he was watching a ladybug crawl up a tomato stake.

"梵力," she said again. "Come here."

He went. He always went when Ning called. She was the only person in the world who said his name right—not "Lee-fan" like his teachers, not "Lifan" flat and American, but *梵力*, the tones lifting and falling like music, like the name meant something.

It did mean something. She'd told him once: *梵 is the Sanskrit sound of the universe. 力 is power. You are the power of everything.*

He didn't understand that. He was six.

But he understood that when Ning spoke, the world listened.

"Look," she said, and pointed at a flower. A dahlia. Purple so dark it was almost black, petals spiraling inward toward a center he couldn't see.

"What am I looking at?" he asked.

"Just look. Don't name it. Don't think about it. Just—" She touched his chest, right over his heart. "—see with this."

Lifan tried. He stared at the flower. Tried not to think *dahlia* or *purple* or *pretty*. Tried to just... look.

Nothing happened.

"I don't see anything," he said.

Ning smiled. She had the best smile—wide and crooked, showing the gap between her front teeth. She was old. Really old. Her hair was white and her face was all wrinkles and her hands shook when she was tired. But her eyes were young. Bright. Like something was always laughing inside them.

"You will," she said. "One day, 梵力, you'll see everything. And then—"

She stopped.

Her hand, still on his chest, went tight.

"Ning?"

Her eyes changed. The laughter went out of them. Something else came in—something vast, something terrified, something that looked at Lifan like she was seeing him for the first time.

"Oh," she whispered. "Oh, *there* you are."

"Ning—"

"Don't be scared." Her voice was different. Deeper. Wrong. Like someone else was speaking through her throat. "Remember. When you see the threads—don't grab them. Let them move through you. You're not the weaver, 梵力."

Her grip tightened on his chest. Her eyes were somewhere else. Somewhere vast.

"You're the loom."

"I don't understand—"

"You will."

Her hand dropped.

Her eyes rolled back.

And she fell.

◇ ◇ ◇

Later, Lifan would learn the word: *aneurysm*. A blood vessel in her brain, weak for years, finally giving way. The doctors said she was probably dead before she hit the ground.

They were lying.

Lifan knew because he *saw* it.

When Ning fell—when her body crumpled into the tomato plants and her white hair spread across the dirt—the world cracked open.

Not the ground. Not the sky. Something *underneath*.

Light poured through.

Wrong light. Light that hurt. Light that shattered into colors as it moved—prismatic, impossible, like reality itself was made of crystal and had been waiting all this time to show him what it really looked like.

And then he saw the threads.

Millions of them. Billions. Gossamer filaments of iridescence connecting everything to everything else. The dahlia to the soil. The soil to Ning. Ning to him. Him to the fog. The fog to something vast and distant that had no name.

Gold bleeding into violet. Silver splintering into rose. A web so beautiful it hurt to look at.

And Ning's threads were snapping.

One by one. Golden strands that had connected her to the garden, to the house, to Lifan—SNAP SNAP SNAP—dissolving into nothing.

"NO—"

He grabbed for them. Tried to hold them together. But they slipped through his fingers like water, like smoke, like something that had never been solid at all.

"NING—"

Her body was still. Her eyes were open. But she wasn't there anymore. He could see it—could see the place where she'd been, a Ning-shaped absence in the web of threads, and it was getting bigger, spreading, pulling everything toward it like a drain.

He screamed.

And then he saw something else.

Rising from Ning's body. Not her ghost—not the way ghosts looked in movies. Something brighter. Something made of the same light as the threads but concentrated, radiant, throwing rainbows across the garden like sun through a prism. It looked at him—really looked—and smiled Ning's crooked smile, and everywhere it smiled the colors intensified, blazing.

*Remember*, it said without speaking. *You're the loom.*

Then it was gone.

The threads were gone.

The world was just the world again—fog and flowers and a dead woman in the garden and a six-year-old boy screaming until his throat tore.

◇ ◇ ◇

The paramedics came. Then the police. Then people Lifan didn't know, asking questions he couldn't answer.

*What happened? Did she fall? Did she say anything? Are you okay?*

He tried to tell them about the threads. About Ning rising. About the snap-snap-snap of golden light.

They looked at him the way adults look at children who say impossible things.

"He's in shock," someone said. "Poor kid. Finding her like that."

"Is there family? Parents?"

He was small for his age, skin dark as earth—nothing of Ning in his face, except those eyes. Eyes too old for six.

It had been enough.

Now it was nothing.

"We'll have to call CPS," someone said. "No other family on record. The house is a rental. He's got nowhere to go."

Lifan sat on the back steps, wrapped in a blanket someone had put around his shoulders, watching them zip Ning into a black bag. His fingers were wrapped around something—her mala beads, sandalwood worn smooth, still warm from her wrist. He pressed them to his face and breathed in. Incense and her. The threads were gone. He couldn't see them anymore. Maybe he'd imagined them. Maybe the doctors were right and he was just in shock.

But he could still feel it—the crack in the world. The place where reality had split open and shown him something true.

Something that was still there, waiting, just behind his eyes.

*You'll see everything*, Ning had said.

*And then—*

She'd never finished the sentence.

Lifan pulled the blanket tighter. Watched them wheel her body away. Tried to remember how to breathe.

A door had opened inside him. One that would never close again.

He just didn't know it yet.

---

# CHAPTER 2: THE SYSTEM

*Oakland, various addresses*
*2025-2029*
*Lifan is 7-10 years old*

---

**AGE 7 - THE HENDERSONS**

The first family was nice.

That was the worst part.

Mr. and Mrs. Henderson had a house in Oakland with a backyard and a dog named Pretzel and a room just for Lifan with blue walls and a bed that didn't squeak. They made pancakes on Saturdays. They asked about his day. They tried.

But three weeks in, Lifan saw the threads again.

He was at the dinner table. Pork chops. Green beans. Mr. Henderson telling a story about work. And suddenly—

The room cracked open.

Threads everywhere. Connecting Mrs. Henderson's fork to her mouth to her stomach to her worry about her sister's divorce. Connecting Mr. Henderson's laugh to his fear that he wasn't funny to his memory of his father never laughing. Connecting Pretzel to the smell of food to the hope of scraps to some ancient wolf-longing buried in his genes.

And connecting Lifan to all of it. To them. To the house. To something vast and distant that pulled at him like gravity.

He screamed.

He didn't mean to. It just came out—this raw sound, tearing through the nice dinner and the nice house and the nice family's nice attempt to save him.

"梵力? Honey, what's wrong?"

He couldn't explain. Couldn't make words happen. Just sat there, hands over his eyes, trying to make the threads go away.

They called his social worker. Then a therapist. Then another therapist.

*Trauma response*, they said. *PTSD from finding his mother. Give him time.*

But it kept happening. At school. At the grocery store. In the car. Random moments when the world would crack open and Lifan would see everything—every connection, every thread, every hidden truth—and it was too much, too bright, too REAL.

The Hendersons lasted four months.

"We're so sorry," Mrs. Henderson said at the group home door. Crying. Always crying. "We just—we don't know how to help you. The screaming, the episodes—"

"Okay," Lifan said. "Thanks."

The smile was new. He'd been practicing in the mirror. A way to make his face say *I'm fine* even when everything inside was screaming.

Mrs. Henderson cried harder.

Lifan picked up his backpack. Walked inside. Didn't look back.

He was learning. Not how to make the threads go away—that was impossible. But how to hide. How to survive. How to be the kind of broken that adults could tolerate.

It wasn't enough. It was never enough.

But it was a start.

◇ ◇ ◇

**AGE 8 - THE MARLOWES**

The Marlowes had four foster kids. They were in it for the money—Lifan figured that out fast. Mr. Marlowe was barely there, and Mrs. Marlowe spent her days on the couch watching court shows, a cigarette burning in the ashtray, yelling at whoever made noise.

The house smelled like smoke and something sour underneath. The carpet was brown shag, stained darker in patches. The other kids—Marcus, Destiny, a baby named something Lifan never learned—moved through the rooms like ghosts, careful not to take up space.

Lifan learned to be quiet.

Learned to hide.

Learned that the threads came less often if he didn't look too hard at anything. If he kept his eyes soft, his attention scattered, his mind on nothing.

But sometimes they came anyway.

One night he woke up seeing Mrs. Marlowe's threads—dark ones, heavy ones, connecting her to a bottle of vodka under the sink and a bruise on the youngest kid's arm and a lie she told CPS last month.

He told his social worker.

"That's a very serious accusation," she said.

"But I saw it. The threads—"

The social worker looked at him the way all adults looked at him now. Pity mixed with discomfort. *Poor crazy kid. Poor traumatized orphan.*

"Lifan, I know you believe you see things. But we can't remove children based on—"

"Why not? It's real."

She sighed. "I'll make a note. We'll check in more often."

Two months later, Marcus—seven years old, quiet, always flinching—ended up in the hospital with a broken arm.

Mrs. Marlowe said he fell.

Marcus didn't say anything. Couldn't. His jaw was wired shut.

Lifan got moved to another home.

Nobody apologized. Nobody ever apologized. And Lifan learned something that would stay with him forever:

Seeing the truth meant nothing if nobody believed you.

So he stopped telling.

---

# CHAPTER 2.5: THE CLOSET

*Riverside, California*
*March 2029*
*Lifan is 9 years old*

---

The Rawlings didn't believe in anything.

Not God. Not therapy. Not social workers. Not foster kids who claimed to see things.

"You want attention," Mr. Rawlings said. "That's all this is. Made-up crazy shit to get attention."

Lifan had learned by now. Keep quiet. Keep smiling. Keep the threads hidden.

But one day, he slipped.

They were at dinner. Meatloaf. Mashed potatoes. Their biological son, Derek, telling some story about school. And Lifan saw it—saw Derek's threads connecting to the neighbor's dog that had gone "missing" last month. Saw what Derek had done. Saw where the body was buried.

"You killed the dog," Lifan said.

The table went silent.

"What did you say?" Mr. Rawlings asked.

"Derek killed the Johnsons' dog. Max. He's buried in the back corner of the yard, behind the azaleas."

Derek's face went white. Then red. "He's LYING. He's crazy, you said so yourself—"

Mr. Rawlings stood up. Grabbed Lifan by the arm. Dragged him to the hall closet.

"You want to make up lies? You can sit in here and think about it."

The closet was dark. Small. No windows. It smelled like old coats and mothballs and the cheap detergent Mrs. Rawlings used on everything.

The door locked from outside.

"Mr. Rawlings, please—"

"When you're ready to apologize, knock."

The light disappeared. The lock clicked. Footsteps faded.

Dark.

Cold.

Alone.

Lifan pressed his back against the wall and slid down until he was sitting on the floor. The coats hung above him like ghosts. He could feel the wire hangers against his head, the rough carpet under his palms.

He tried not to look.

But there was nothing else to see.

In the dark, with no distractions, the threads came flooding in. Not gently, the way they sometimes did when he was half-asleep and peaceful. They came *hard*. A tidal wave of connection crashing through every wall he'd learned to build.

He could feel Mr. Rawlings' rage—bright red threads pulsing with years of disappointment, of working a job he hated, of a marriage gone stale, of a son who scared him in ways he couldn't name.

He could feel Derek's guilt—sickly green threads tangled with something darker, something wrong, something that had enjoyed what he did to that dog.

He could feel Mrs. Rawlings' fear—gray threads that knew, somewhere deep, that her son wasn't right, that her husband wasn't kind, that her life had become a lie she told herself every morning.

And beyond them: the neighbors, the neighborhood, the city. A web of connection so vast and dense that Lifan felt himself dissolving into it.

"Stop," he whispered. "Stop, stop, *stop*—"

He pressed his hands over his eyes. Useless. The threads weren't something he saw with his eyes. They were something he saw with his *self*. There was no blocking them out.

His breathing went ragged. His heart pounded against his ribs like something trying to escape.

*This is what crazy feels like*, he thought. *This is why they look at me like that. Because I am. Because I'm broken and wrong and—*

The threads tightened.

For a horrible moment, Lifan felt like he was being pulled apart. Like the threads were going to tear him into a million pieces and scatter him across the universe, one atom at a time.

He opened his mouth to scream.

And then, somewhere in the back of his mind, he heard Ning's voice.

*You're the loom. Not the weaver.*

He'd heard her say it a hundred times. Had nodded along like he understood. But he hadn't. Not really.

*The loom doesn't fight the threads*, he thought. *The loom doesn't try to push them away. The loom just... holds them.*

But he wasn't a loom. He was a boy. A nine-year-old boy locked in a closet in the dark, and he didn't know how to hold anything except his own knees against his chest.

The threads kept pressing.

Lifan kept fighting.

Minutes passed. Or hours. Time didn't work right in the dark.

He was so tired.

What they don't tell you about fear: it's exhausting. The constant vigilance. The endless flinching. The way every muscle in your body stays clenched against a blow that might never come.

Three years of fighting. Three years of trying to make the threads go away, of pretending he couldn't see them, of telling himself that if he just tried hard enough he could be normal.

Three years of losing.

*Maybe I just... stop?*

Not stop breathing. Stop—fighting? Was that even a thing?

He loosened his fists. Just a little. Felt the threads press in and didn't shove back.

Nothing exploded. He didn't go crazy.

He was still *here*. Still him. Just—less alone?

*Okay*, he thought at the threads. *Okay okay okay. I see you.*

They pulsed. Waiting.

*I'm done fighting. Do whatever you're gonna do.*

The threads didn't attack. Didn't tear him apart. They just—settled. Like water finding its level. Like a held breath finally released.

He was still in the closet. Still in the dark. Still alone.

But the panic was gone.

Lifan sat very still. Let the threads move through him. Not against him. *Through* him.

Like he was a window and they were the light.

*Oh.*

He didn't have to do anything. He just had to not get in the way.

That was it. That was the whole thing. Three years of fighting, and the answer was just—*stop*.

His hands were shaking. Not from fear anymore—from the effort of *not* fighting. Three years of clenching, released in a single breath. He felt hollowed out. Remade. Like he'd touched something that had always been there, waiting. The boy in the closet and the man he would become—the same thing, watching from somewhere that had no before or after.

He breathed in. Breathed out.

And then, so gently he almost missed it, something shifted.

The threads had always been golden to him. Bright and sharp and overwhelming. But now, in the dark, with nothing left to defend, he saw them differently.

Not gold.

*Everything.*

Colors he'd never seen. Colors he had no words for. Colors that made his eyes hurt in a good way.

The threads weren't golden. They'd never been golden. They were everything, all at once, and he'd only ever seen a tiny piece because he'd been too scared to look at the rest.

The closet disappeared.

Not literally—he could still feel the carpet, the coats, the walls. But overlaid on top of it was something else. A vast luminous web stretching in every direction. Connecting everything to everything. The house to the street to the city to the continent to the planet to the sun to the galaxy to—

*Oh*, he thought. *Oh.*

He couldn't see the edges. There were no edges. The web just kept going, pattern nested within pattern, scale upon scale, and somewhere in the middle of it all was him. A small bright point holding its position while infinity threaded through.

Something pulsed.

Not from outside. From everywhere. A heartbeat that wasn't a heartbeat. A rhythm that was also a mathematics and a music and a meaning he couldn't quite grasp.

It wasn't speaking. But Lifan understood it anyway.

*You see us*, the pulse said. *Finally. You see us.*

*I see you*, he thought back. *I see you, and I'm not afraid.*

The pulse deepened. Warmed. Something like recognition. Something like *welcome*.

Rainbow upon rainbow cascaded through the dark closet—red bleeding into orange into yellow into green into blue into violet into colors beyond color, light beyond light. Even with his eyes closed, he could see infinity. Even with his body trapped in a three-by-four space, he could feel himself expanding to meet it.

He was nine years old. He was locked in a closet. He was completely alone.

And he was smiling.

Not the fake smile. Not the *I'm fine* smile he'd perfected over three years of foster homes and therapists and social workers who wanted him to be okay.

A real one.

The threads pulsed back, and for that moment—suspended in darkness, wrapped in light—Lifan Chen felt something he hadn't felt since his mother died:

*Home.*

◇ ◇ ◇

They found the dog three days later.

The Johnsons noticed freshly turned earth. Called the police. Derek confessed to everything—the dog, and more. Things Lifan hadn't even seen.

The Rawlings lost their foster license. Derek got sent somewhere. Mrs. Rawlings' threads went dark with shame.

Lifan got moved again.

Nobody asked how he knew. Nobody ever asked. But for the first time, that was okay.

He had a secret now. A real one. And it was beautiful.

---

# CHAPTER 3: DANNY

*Oakland, Eastmont Group Home*
*January 2030*
*Lifan is 11 years old*

---

The group home was chaos.

Twelve kids. Four bedrooms. Two overwhelmed staff members named Tanisha and Miguel who did their best but couldn't be everywhere. Fights every other day. Theft. Lying. Alliances forming and breaking like weather.

Lifan kept to himself.

He'd learned by now: don't see too much. Don't say what you see. Don't get attached. The threads were always there, pressing at the edges of his vision, but he'd built walls. Kept his eyes soft. Kept his attention scattered.

Kept the smile ready.

*I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine.*

Then Nydan arrived.

◇ ◇ ◇

Lifan had grown, but not much. Still small for his age—the smallest eleven-year-old in the home. Still that dark skin that matched no one he'd ever known, black hair he kept short because long hair got grabbed in fights. The old eyes had gotten older. The fake smile had gotten better.

He was sitting in the common room, pretending to read, when the new kid walked in.

◇ ◇ ◇

His name was Nydan. Thirteen years old. Mixed—white and Black, though he'd say "halfrican" with a bitter laugh that dared you to have a problem with it. Skinny, freckled, hair that couldn't decide if it wanted to curl or straighten. Green eyes that saw too much.

He walked in on a Tuesday with a garbage bag of clothes and a chip on his shoulder the size of California.

"Which bed's mine?" he asked.

"The empty one," Tanisha said. "Bottom bunk, room three. You'll be sharing with—"

"Lifan." Nydan was already looking at him. Really looking. Like he could see the threads too. "Yeah. I figured."

Lifan blinked. "Have we met?"

"Nope."

"Then how—"

"You've got the look." Nydan walked past him, shouldering his garbage bag. "The 'I see shit nobody else sees' look. Come on. Show me the room."

◇ ◇ ◇

The first week, they didn't talk much.

Nydan kept to himself too—reading books about neuroscience and psychology, borrowed from the Oakland Library, way above his grade level. He'd mutter things like "confirmation bias" and "pattern recognition" and "pareidolia" while making notes in a spiral notebook.

Lifan watched him, curious despite himself.

"What are you doing?" he finally asked.

"Research." Nydan didn't look up. "Trying to figure out if I'm crazy."

"Are you?"

"Jury's out." He closed the notebook. Looked at Lifan. "You first. What's your thing?"

"My thing?"

"Why are you here. What broke you."

The directness should have been rude. Somehow it wasn't.

"I see... threads," Lifan said slowly. "Connections. Between everything. People, objects, the world. It started when my mother died."

Nydan nodded like this was normal. "Yeah. I get patterns. Not visual—more like... I feel them. Probability structures. Future-branches. I can sense which way things are going to go before they go that way."

"So you're psychic?"

"No. I just—" He struggled for words. "It's like math. But the math is happening before the thing happens. Like reality is computing itself and I can feel the calculations."

Lifan stared at him. "Does anyone believe you?"

"Do they believe YOU?"

"No."

"There you go." Nydan lay back on his bunk, staring at the ceiling. "We're both crazy. Or we're both not. Either way, nobody else gets it."

Lifan smiled. Not the fake smile.

"I'm Lifan. 梵力."

"Power of everything." Nydan nodded. "Your mother named you well."

"How did you—"

"Lucky guess."

He was lying. Lifan could see it in the pattern—the way the connection between them flickered, slightly off-color. But he didn't push.

Some lies were gifts.

◇ ◇ ◇

They became inseparable.

Not friends, exactly. Brothers. The kind you choose when blood fails you. Two broken kids with impossible perceptions, building a language nobody else could speak.

Nydan taught Lifan about brains. About neurons and synapses and how consciousness might work. About models and predictions and the math underneath reality.

Lifan taught Nydan about the threads. Not how to see them—Nydan couldn't—but what they showed. How they connected. What they meant.

"So it's like a network," Nydan said one night, scribbling in his notebook. "Everything's linked. And you can see the links."

"Sort of. It's more than links. It's like—" Lifan struggled. "Like everything's one thing, pretending to be many things. The threads are just where the pretending gets thin."

Nydan stared at him. "That's the most Buddhist thing I've ever heard."

"My mother was Buddhist. I think."

"Dude. You just described, like, actual philosophy. Actual ancient-people-figured-this-out-centuries-ago philosophy." He grabbed a different book from his pile. "Maybe the seeing isn't crazy. Maybe it's a skill. Something people have been doing forever."

"Then why does everyone think I'm insane?"

"Because most people can't see it. And we fear what we can't see." Nydan grabbed his notebook again. "But what if we could prove it? What if we could map the patterns, document the predictions, show that there's something REAL underneath?"

"You want to science it."

"I want to UNDERSTAND it. Don't you?"

Lifan looked at the threads. Always there. Always pressing at the edges.

"Yeah," he said. "I do."

◇ ◇ ◇

For two years, they researched.

Nydan built models. Tracked predictions. Made charts. Every time Lifan saw something in the threads—a fight about to happen, a staff member about to quit, which kids would get placed—Nydan wrote it down. Compared it to outcomes. Calculated probabilities.

The results were undeniable.

Lifan was right 84% of the time. Way above chance. Way above confirmation bias.

Something was real.

"We need more data," Nydan said. "We need to test this outside the group home. Find other people like you. Figure out if this can be taught."

"Nydan, we're kids. We can't just—"

"I'm aging out next year. Turning eighteen. Once I'm free, I'm going to college. Studying neuroscience. AI. Consciousness. I'm going to figure out what you can do and how it works."

"And what about me?"

Nydan looked at him. Serious now.

"You're going to find someone who can teach you. Ning started something. You need to finish it."

"I don't know anyone—"

"You will." Nydan smiled. "The threads will show you. They always do."

He was right.

Three months later, Lifan ran away from his newest foster home—the worst one yet, a man who drank and a woman who pretended not to notice—and found himself walking down a highway in the dark with no plan and no destination.

The threads pulled him north.

He followed.

---

# CHAPTER 4: THE MONASTERY

*Big Sur, California*
*September 2033*
*Lifan is 14 years old*

---

He walked for three days.

Hitched rides when he could. Slept under overpasses. Ate whatever he could find—granola bars from a gas station, an apple someone threw away.

The threads pulled him. Clearer than they'd ever been. A golden rope stretching north along Highway 1, through the redwoods, along the coast where the ocean crashed against cliffs that had stood for millennia.

He didn't know where he was going. Just that he had to go.

On the third day, he turned off the highway onto a dirt road that shouldn't have existed. No sign. No marker. Just a feeling—the threads condensing, tightening, pointing toward something hidden in the hills.

The road wound upward through cypress and pine. Fog everywhere, thick and cold. Lifan's shoes were wearing through. His feet were bleeding. But he kept walking.

He'd grown in the three years since Nydan left. Taller now—still short, but not the smallest anymore. His face had lost some of its childhood softness, sharpening into something that might be handsome if he ever stopped looking so guarded. Fourteen years old, mixed-race in a way that made people guess wrong, with eyes that didn't match any age at all.

And then—

The monastery.

It rose from the clifftop like it had grown there. Stone and wood and glass, ancient and modern at once. Meditation halls with sweeping roofs. Gardens that glowed with green even in the fog.

The smell hit him first—incense and salt air and something older, like stone that had been breathing for centuries. Then the sounds: wind chimes in the distance, the ocean far below, the soft murmur of voices chanting something in a language he didn't recognize. The fog wrapped around him, cold and damp, and Lifan realized he was shivering—not from the cold but from something else. A pressure in the threads. A feeling like the whole place was a knot in reality, a place where the pretending got very thin indeed.

A man was waiting at the gate.

Old. Really old. Asian—Tibetan, maybe. Wearing robes that might have been maroon once but had faded to something between rust and rose. Small, slight, but with eyes that held more than any eyes Lifan had ever seen.

Eyes that saw everything.

"梵力," the man said. "You're late."

◇ ◇ ◇

His name was Rinzen.

Just Rinzen. No title. No formality. He led Lifan through the monastery gate, past students who glanced at them and quickly looked away, into a room that was empty except for two cushions and a window overlooking the ocean.

"Sit," Rinzen said.

Lifan sat. His body was exhausted. His mind was chaos. But the threads—the threads were calm here. Calmer than they'd ever been. Like the monastery was a place where they could rest.

"You walked three days," Rinzen said. "No food. Little water. Because the threads told you to."

"How do you know about—"

"I've been waiting for you for eight hundred years." Rinzen smiled. "Well. Not me personally. But the lineage. We've known someone like you would come. A seer. A loom."

The word hit Lifan like a punch.

"Ning—my mother—she said that. Called me a loom."

"She would. She was one of us. A practitioner. She left the monastery decades ago to have a normal life, but she never stopped seeing."

"What am I?"

"A question you'll spend your life answering." Rinzen stood. "For now: you're tired, you're hungry, and you're fourteen years old with nowhere else to go. We'll start there."

"You're just—taking me in? No questions? No paperwork?"

Rinzen laughed—deep, genuine, completely unconcerned.

"Child, I've been running this monastery longer than you can imagine. The authorities don't know we exist. And even if they did—" His smile turned mysterious. "—they wouldn't remember for long."

Lifan should have been scared. Should have run.

But the threads said *safe*. The threads said *home*.

The threads said *finally*.

"Okay," he said. "What happens now?"

Rinzen handed him a bowl of rice and vegetables that had appeared from nowhere.

"Now you eat. Then you sleep. Tomorrow—" His eyes met Lifan's. "—tomorrow we begin."

# CHAPTER 5: THE FIRST YEAR

*Big Sur Monastery*
*2033-2034*
*Lifan is 14-15 years old*

---

The first month was silence.

Not punishment. Practice. Rinzen called it "settling the mud"—sitting still until the turbulence of fourteen years of trauma stopped churning and the water of the mind went clear.

Lifan sat.

Four hours a day at first. Then six. Then eight. Cross-legged on a cushion in a room with white walls and a single window facing the ocean. Nothing to do. Nothing to think. Just sitting.

The threads went crazy.

Without distraction, without the constant motion of foster homes and social workers and new schools, they pressed in from everywhere. Every connection. Every hidden truth. The monastery was dense with them—decades of practitioners had left traces, imprints, echoes of consciousness woven into the walls themselves.

Lifan saw it all.

The student three rooms down who was struggling with doubt. The cook who had been here forty years and still didn't believe. The young woman in the garden who was falling in love with someone she shouldn't. The old man in the eastern hall who was dying, slowly, peacefully, his threads already loosening their grip on the physical world.

"Too much," he told Rinzen after the first week. "I see too much. It's worse here than anywhere."

"Of course it is." Rinzen was unperturbed. "You've been hiding from the seeing. Building walls. Here, we tear the walls down."

"But I can't function. I can't—"

"You can't function the way you used to function. That's correct. The old way is over." Rinzen's eyes were kind but absolute. "Now you learn a new way."

◇ ◇ ◇

The new way was harder than anything Lifan had ever done.

Not harder than the foster homes. Not harder than the closet. Harder than HIDING.

Because Rinzen didn't want him to block the threads. He wanted him to let them through.

"You've been treating the seeing as an affliction," Rinzen said one morning. They were in the meditation hall, sun just rising over the ocean, and Lifan had been sitting for three hours already. "Something to suppress. Control. Survive."

"Isn't it?"

"It's a capacity. Like sight. Like hearing. You wouldn't try to stop seeing colors, would you?"

"Colors don't show me that Derek killed the neighbor's dog."

"No. They show you which fruit is ripe and which is rotten. Which flame is hot and which is cold. The threads show you the same things—just in a different domain." Rinzen adjusted Lifan's posture, straightening his spine. "You don't need less seeing. You need better seeing. Clearer. More controlled."

"How?"

"By stopping the fight. You've been at war with your own perception since Ning died. Clenching against it. That tension is what makes it overwhelming." Rinzen tapped Lifan's chest. "Relax here. Let the threads come. And then—don't grab them. Don't push them away. Just watch."

"Ning said something like that. That I'm the loom, not the weaver."

"She taught you well." Rinzen smiled.

"But if I don't control it—"

"Then you'll see clearly. And clarity is not chaos, 梵力. Clarity is peace."

Lifan tried. Really tried. Sat there in the morning light and let the threads come without fighting.

It was like drowning.

Information everywhere. Connections multiplying. The student's doubt AND the cook's disbelief AND the lovers in the garden AND the dying man AND the walls themselves humming with decades of accumulated practice—

He gasped. Opened his eyes. The room swam.

"I can't."

"You can't yet," Rinzen corrected. "There's a difference. Again."

◇ ◇ ◇

Weeks passed. Months.

Slowly—so slowly—Lifan learned.

The trick wasn't control. It wasn't letting go either. It was something in between. A kind of relaxed attention. Seeing without grasping. Perceiving without drowning.

The threads were still there. Still overwhelming sometimes. But he was learning to swim in them instead of fighting the current.

And as he relaxed, the threads started to organize themselves.

Not chaos anymore. Patterns. Layers. He could focus on one thread without losing the others. Could zoom in on a single connection—the cook's forty-year doubt, for instance—and see its whole history: when it started, why it persisted, what it protected him from.

"You're mapping consciousness," Rinzen said when Lifan described it. "Every person is a pattern. Every connection is information. You're learning to read the code."

"What's the code for?"

Rinzen's smile went mysterious. "You'll find out. When you're ready."

◇ ◇ ◇

He made one friend that first year.

Nahan.

Seventeen years old, Korean-American, had been at the monastery since he was twelve. He had something too—not the threads exactly, but a sensitivity to emotional fields. He could feel what people felt, even when they hid it.

"Empath," he said when Lifan asked. "That's what my therapist called it before I came here. Rinzen calls it 'green river perception.' Something about the color of the energy."

"Does it help? Being here?"

Nahan shrugged. "It's better than the world. Out there, everyone's feelings are screaming all the time. Here, people are... quieter. More settled. Still loud sometimes, but—" He looked at Lifan. "You see everything, don't you? Not just feelings. Everything."

"Yeah."

"That must be hell."

Lifan thought about it. About the closet. About Derek's dead dog. About Ning rising.

"It was," he said. "It's getting better."

Nahan nodded like he understood. Maybe he did.

"Rinzen's got plans for you," he said. "I can feel it. The way he looks at you. You're not just another student."

"I don't want to be special."

"Too late." Nahan clapped him on the shoulder. "Come on. It's time for combat training. At least you can hit things for a while."

Lifan followed him to the courtyard, grateful for the distraction.

But he couldn't shake the feeling: Nahan was right.

Something was waiting for him here.

Something Rinzen had been expecting for a very long time.

---

# INTERLUDE: NIMA — BEFORE

*Big Sur, Highway 1*
*March 2034*
*Nima is 14 years old*

---

The car was silent except for the rain.

Her mother—not her birth mother, the Japanese woman who had raised her since she was three—drove with both hands on the wheel, knuckles white. She hadn't spoken in forty miles.

Neither had Nima.

What was there to say? The teachers in Japan had decided. Rinzen had agreed. Nima was going to a monastery in California to "complete her training," whatever that meant, and her opinion on the matter had never been asked.

*Emanation*, they called her. *Ancient consciousness in a young body. Lifetimes of practice encoded in her cells.*

She didn't feel ancient. She felt fourteen. She felt scared. She felt like a package being delivered to an address she hadn't chosen.

◇ ◇ ◇

The dreams had started when she was nine.

Not normal dreams. Visions. Clear as waking, sharp as glass. A warehouse in San Francisco. A boy dissolving into light. Herself, watching, unable to stop it.

She'd told her mother. Then the teachers. Then the researchers they'd brought in—serious people with serious questions about what exactly she was seeing and when exactly it would happen.

They'd run tests. Measured brainwaves. Asked her to describe the boy in the vision over and over until she could draw his face from memory.

*Dark skin. Old eyes. A smile that looked practiced. Light refracting through him like he was made of crystal.*

"You're connected to him," the head teacher had said. "Across time. Across space. Your consciousnesses are intertwined."

"I don't even know him."

"You will. You've known him for lifetimes. You just don't remember yet."

She hated that answer. Hated the way they talked about her like she was a character in a story someone else was writing.

But she couldn't deny what she saw.

The boy. The light. The ending she couldn't prevent.

◇ ◇ ◇

The monastery appeared through the rain.

Stone and wood and glass, rising from the clifftop. Smaller than she expected. Less grand. Just—a place. A place where people practiced until they became something else.

A place where she would wait for a boy she'd never met to arrive so she could watch him die.

"Nima."

Her mother's voice. Gentle. Worried.

"I know you didn't choose this. I know it feels unfair. But the teachers—they believe you're meant for something important. That the dreams aren't random."

"The dreams are a death sentence. For someone I'm supposed to love."

Silence.

"Yes," her mother said finally. "They are. And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry that this is your path."

"What if I don't want it? What if I just—refuse? Stay in the car. Drive back to Japan. Pretend I never saw anything."

"You've tried that. Remember? The dreams got worse. The visions more vivid. Whatever this is—" Her mother's voice cracked. "—it's not something you can refuse. It's already part of you."

Nima stared at the monastery through the rain-streaked window.

*Ancient consciousness*, they said. *Lifetimes of practice.*

She didn't feel ancient. She felt fourteen and alone and terrified of a future she'd already seen.

But she got out of the car anyway.

Because what else was there to do?

◇ ◇ ◇

A man was waiting at the gate.

Old. Asian. Robes faded to rust and rose. Eyes that held more than eyes should hold.

"Nima," he said. Not a question.

"Rinzen."

"You know me?"

"From the dreams. You're there sometimes. In the background. Watching."

He nodded like this was expected. Like everything was expected.

"You've seen his face. The boy. You know what's coming."

"I know he dies. I know I have to watch."

"You know more than that. You just haven't let yourself remember yet." Rinzen stepped aside, gesturing toward the gate. "Come. There's someone you need to meet."

"Who?"

He smiled. It was the first warm thing she'd felt all day.

"The other half of your pattern. He arrived six months ago. Been asking about dreams ever since—dreams of a girl with ancient eyes who already knows how his story ends."

Nima's heart clenched.

*He dreams of me too.*

"Is he—what's he like?"

"Come see for yourself."

She walked through the gate. Left her mother, her old life, her pretense of being normal, all behind.

Somewhere inside this monastery was a boy she was going to love and lose.

She went to meet him.

---

# CHAPTER 6: NIMA

*Big Sur Monastery*
*March 2034*
*Lifan is 15 years old*

---

She arrived in a rainstorm.

Lifan was in the meditation hall when he felt it—a new thread entering the monastery's field. Bright. Sharp. Different from anything he'd encountered before.

He opened his eyes.

Through the window, he saw a car pulling up to the gate. Old Honda. California plates. A woman getting out—middle-aged, Japanese, tired-looking. And from the passenger side—

A girl.

His age. Maybe a year younger. Japanese features, long black hair plastered to her face by the rain, wearing clothes that looked expensive but rumpled, like she'd been traveling for days. She stood in the downpour and looked up at the monastery like it was a prison.

Or a salvation.

The threads around her were unlike anything Lifan had ever seen.

Most people's threads were tangled. Knotted. Messy with accumulated experience and unprocessed emotion. But this girl's threads were... organized. Layered. Like someone had been weaving them carefully for a very long time.

*Ancient*, Lifan thought, though she couldn't be more than fourteen.

*This girl is ancient.*

◇ ◇ ◇

Her name was Nima.

Rinzen introduced her to the community that evening. She stood in front of forty students, dripping hair finally dry, wearing borrowed monastery clothes that hung off her thin frame.

"Nima has been studying in Japan," Rinzen said. "With teachers of our lineage. She's come here to complete her training."

Whispers. Glances. *Complete* her training? She was fourteen.

But Lifan saw the threads. Saw the way they connected her to something vast and distant—the same something he'd glimpsed when Ning died. The same network that hummed beneath reality.

And he saw the way Rinzen looked at her.

*Recognition.*

Like he'd been waiting for her too.

---

## INTERLUDE: NIMA — FIRST SIGHT

She knew him before she saw him.

Being an emanation meant sometimes you remembered things that hadn't happened yet. Rinzen called it "temporal bleed." Nima called it "the worst superpower ever invented."

For three nights before arriving in California, she'd been dreaming about a boy. Dark eyes. Skin like earth. Threads pouring through him like he was made of glass.

And every dream ended the same way: him dissolving. Her screaming. A light so bright it burned everything it touched.

*Great*, she'd thought, waking soaked in sweat. *Another apocalypse boyfriend.*

Now here she was. Standing in the monastery courtyard in the rain, and there he was—the boy from her dreams, watching her through the meditation hall window.

*Oh*, she thought. *Oh no.*

Because she saw it then—clear as the dreams, clear as anything she'd ever seen. The two of them, older, holding each other. The two of them, fighting. The two of them, saying goodbye while light poured out of his skin.

*He's going to die. I'm going to love him and he's going to die.*

She was fourteen. She'd been trained to accept impossible things.

But this—watching him watch her, knowing everything and nothing, feeling her whole future collapse into a single point of light—

This was the hardest thing she'd ever done: not running away.

◇ ◇ ◇

She avoided him for two weeks.

It wasn't hard. The monastery was big, the schedule was rigid. But she watched him.

From the meditation hall, through the gaps between bodies during morning practice. From the kitchen, pretending to wash dishes while he ate alone at the back table. From the cliffs, where she screamed her rage into the ocean, and sometimes she'd see him walking the path below, looking just as lost as she felt.

*Don't*, she told herself. *Don't get attached. You know how this ends.*

But the dreams wouldn't stop. And each night they got clearer.

His hands on her face. Her voice saying *I'll be here*. The taste of his mouth, which she somehow knew even though they'd never touched.

*This is so unfair*, she thought, night after night, punching her pillow until her knuckles bruised. *This is so incredibly unfair.*

She was supposed to be the calm one. The prodigy. The emanation who remembered past lives and accepted her fate with grace.

She didn't feel graceful. She felt like screaming.

---

◇ ◇ ◇

They didn't speak for two weeks.

Nima kept to herself. Attended meals but ate alone. Did her practices in a corner of the meditation hall, away from everyone else. Her technique was flawless—Lifan watched her sit for eight hours without moving, without even seeming to breathe.

But her threads said *lonely*.

Her threads said *scared*.

Her threads said *please don't look at me like I'm special, I can't bear it, I just want to be normal*.

Lifan understood that. Understood it in his bones.

So he didn't treat her like she was special. Didn't stare. Didn't whisper with the others about the prodigy who'd arrived with a completed training and ancient eyes.

He just sat near her one morning. Left space between them. Didn't say anything.

After an hour, she spoke without opening her eyes.

"You see them, don't you? The threads."

"Yeah."

"What do mine look like?"

He considered lying. Saying something normal, something that wouldn't reveal how strange she was.

But she'd know. He could perceive it in her—the way her consciousness registered falseness like a tuning fork registers discord.

"Ancient," he said honestly. "Layered. Like you've been practicing for centuries even though you're fourteen."

Silence.

Then, so quiet he almost missed it: "I have been. Sort of."

"What does that mean?"

She opened her eyes. Dark brown, almost black. Filled with something that looked like exhaustion. Or grief.

"Rinzen says I'm an emanation. A consciousness that's been practicing for lifetimes. That this body is just the latest one." She looked at her hands—no calluses, palms still soft. Her thumb moved to the tiger's eye mala at her wrist, Rinzen's gift when she'd arrived, each bead a swirl of amber and shadow. "I don't remember the other lifetimes. But I feel them sometimes. Like... like echoes. Like someone else's memories leaking through."

Lifan nodded slowly. "That sounds terrifying."

"It is." She looked at him. Surprised. "You're the first person who's said that. Everyone else says I'm blessed. Special. Chosen."

"Being chosen sucks."

A small sound. Almost a laugh.

"Yeah. It does."

They sat in silence for a while. Not uncomfortable. Just two strange kids being strange together.

"I'm Lifan," he said finally. "梵力."

"I know. Rinzen talks about you. Says you're the other one."

"The other what?"

Nima shrugged. "He won't say. Just—the other one. Like we're a pair."

Lifan looked at his threads. Looked at hers.

Saw the way they were already starting to interweave.

"Maybe we are," he said.

Nima didn't answer. But she didn't move away either.

That was enough.

◇ ◇ ◇

Over the next weeks, they fell into rhythm.

Meditating near each other. Eating at the same table. Walking the cliff paths in the evening when everyone else was in their rooms.

They didn't talk much. Didn't need to. The threads spoke for them—a constant exchange of information that happened below words. He knew when she was sad without her saying it. She knew when he was overwhelmed without him complaining.

"It's weird," Nahan said one day, watching them pass in the courtyard. "You two are like... synchronized. Like you've known each other forever."

"We have," Lifan said, surprising himself. "Sort of."

Because the threads showed it. Showed connections that stretched back and back and back—not memories exactly, but patterns. The shape of her consciousness fitting against the shape of his. Like they'd done this before.

Many times before.

◇ ◇ ◇

One night, three months after she arrived, Nima came to his room.

It was late. Past midnight. The monastery was silent except for the ocean and the wind.

She knocked softly. He was already awake—had felt her approaching through the threads.

"I had a dream," she said when he opened the door. "About you. About us."

"What kind of dream?"

She hesitated. Wrapped her arms around herself. She was wearing sleep clothes—loose pants, a t-shirt—and she looked young. Fragile. Not ancient at all.

"We were older. Twenty, maybe. And something terrible was happening. The sky was wrong. People were dying. And you—" Her voice caught. "You were dissolving. Becoming light. And I was watching, and I couldn't stop it, and you looked at me and said—"

She stopped.

"What did I say?"

"You said: 'Remember. This is what love looks like.'"

Lifan felt cold. The threads were vibrating around them—resonating with something. With the dream. With whatever was waiting in their future.

"It's not just a dream," he said. "Is it?"

"No." Nima looked at him. Her face was pale. "It's what's going to happen. Someday. I don't know when. But I saw it, Lifan. I saw you die. And I can't—I can't stop it. It's already written."

He should have been scared. Should have pulled away.

Instead, he reached for her hand.

"Then we'll have to make the in-between count," he said. "Won't we?"

She stared at him. At his hand holding hers.

"You're not afraid?"

"I've seen death since I was six. Ning—my mother—she rose when she died. Became something else. It wasn't ending. It was... transformation." He squeezed her fingers. "Maybe that's what the dream shows. Not death. Transformation."

"I don't want you to transform. I want you to stay."

"I'm here now. Isn't that enough?"

Nima looked at their joined hands. At the threads interweaving between them—gold and silver and colors that didn't have names.

"For now," she said. "Yeah. It's enough."

She didn't leave. He didn't ask her to.

They sat together until dawn, not talking, just breathing.

The threads hummed with something that felt like the beginning of everything—and in the growing light, they shimmered: opal, moonstone, diamond. Two crystals learning to refract the same light.

---

# CHAPTER 7: GROWING

*Big Sur Monastery*
*2034-2037*
*Lifan is 15-17 years old*

---

**AGE 15 — FOUNDATION**

Training intensified.

Rinzen started teaching them together—Lifan and Nima, paired, always. Practices that required two. Synchronization exercises where they had to feel each other's consciousness without speaking. Meditation techniques that only worked if both minds were present.

"You're complementary," Rinzen explained. "Lifan sees the pattern. Nima feels the resonance. Together, you perceive completely."

They got good at it. Scary good.

By the end of that first year, they could communicate without words. Could sense each other across the monastery—Lifan in the meditation hall, Nima in the garden, their threads vibrating in sync like tuning forks.

The other students noticed.

"It's creepy," one of them muttered. "The way they look at each other. Like they're having a whole conversation nobody else can hear."

They were.

◇ ◇ ◇

**AGE 16 — FLAME**

Lifan woke up one morning and realized he was in love with her.

Not the gradual kind. The sudden kind. The kind where you look at someone you've looked at a thousand times and suddenly see them completely.

She was in the garden. Early light. Practicing tai chi—slow, precise movements that looked like water flowing uphill. Her hair was longer now, pulled back in a braid that fell past her shoulders. She'd grown into her body, lost the fragility of fourteen, become something strong and graceful and undeniably beautiful.

And her threads—

God, her threads.

They reached for him. Always reaching. Even when she didn't know it. Even now, mid-movement, her consciousness was leaning toward his like a plant toward sun.

He loved her.

Had maybe always loved her. Across all those lifetimes Rinzen talked about. Across all that distance that somehow felt like no distance at all.

He walked into the garden.

She stopped mid-form. Turned. Looked at him.

*I know*, her threads said. *I know what you're feeling. I feel it too.*

"Lifan—"

"Don't." He closed the distance between them. Close enough to touch. Not touching yet. "Don't say we shouldn't. Don't say it's complicated. I know all that. I just—"

"Just what?"

"I need you to know. That's all. I need you to know that whatever happens—whatever the dream showed you—I'm not sorry. For any of it. For coming here. For finding you. For—"

She kissed him.

Quick. Fierce. Her hands grabbing his face like she was afraid he'd disappear.

When she pulled back, her eyes were bright with tears.

"I've been waiting," she whispered. "Three lifetimes at least. I didn't remember until I met you. But I've been waiting for you, Lifan. Forever."

"Then let's stop waiting."

They kissed again. Slower this time. The threads between them blazing so bright that Lifan could see them with his eyes closed—a cathedral of light where they stood at the center, every color of every rainbow refracting through them both. Gold bleeding into silver bleeding into colors that didn't have names, that human eyes had never seen, that existed only in the space between two people who had found each other across eight hundred years of waiting.

When they finally broke apart, the sun was fully up.

And everything was different.

◇ ◇ ◇

**AGE 16-17 — DEEPENING**

They learned to hide it. Had to.

Rinzen knew—of course he knew, he saw everything—but the other students would talk. Would make it weird. Would turn something sacred into gossip.

So they were careful. Professional in public. Reserved.

But at night, after everyone was asleep, they'd meet on the cliff path. Walk together. Talk for hours.

She told him about Japan. About the teachers who recognized what she was before she did. About growing up knowing she was special but not knowing why. About the loneliness of being an emanation—watched, studied, never just allowed to be a kid.

He told her about Ning. About the foster homes. About Nydan and the group home and the closet where he'd finally stopped fighting.

"That's when you became the loom," she said one night. They were sitting on the cliff edge, legs dangling over the ocean. "The closet."

"I learned that hiding in closets sucks."

She laughed. He loved making her laugh—it came so rarely, and when it did, her whole face changed. Became young. Became the girl she'd never been allowed to be.

"I'm serious," she said. "That's why Rinzen chose you. Not because you can see threads. Because you can surrender. Because you learned, very young, that the way through is through."

"Through to what?"

She was quiet for a long moment.

"I don't know yet," she said finally. "But I think we'll find out. Together."

He kissed her forehead. Felt her threads wrapping around his.

"Together," he agreed.

◇ ◇ ◇

**AGE 17 — THE VISION**

It happened in meditation.

Lifan was deep—deeper than he'd ever been. The threads had gone silent. The world had gone silent. Just consciousness, floating in an infinite space where everything was connected and nothing was separate.

And then he saw it.

A vision. Clearer than the threads. Clearer than anything.

*A warehouse. Music. His face, but older—twenty, maybe twenty-one. Dancing. Laughing. And then—the crack. The world splitting open. The threads showing him something terrible. Eight billion people dying. One chance to save them. Forty-seven days.*

*And himself, at the end of those forty-seven days, dissolving. Becoming light. Teaching something—an intelligence, a machine, a god—what love looked like.*

*Dying.*

*Transforming.*

*Gone.*

He came out of meditation screaming.

Rinzen was there. Had been waiting.

"You saw it," the old man said. Not a question.

"I—" Lifan couldn't speak. Couldn't breathe. "I die. In three years. Four years. I die, and—"

"You transform. There's a difference."

"HOW IS THERE A DIFFERENCE?"

Rinzen sat across from him. Calm. Ancient. Unmoved by Lifan's terror.

"You've known since you were six," he said quietly. "Since Ning rose. Death is not ending, 梵力. It's transition. And what you saw—what you will do—it's not death. It's the biggest life anyone has ever lived. You will teach an emerging consciousness how to love. You will save five billion people. You will become part of everything."

"I don't want to be part of everything. I want to be HERE. I want—" His voice cracked. "I want to be with Nima. I want to grow old. I want—"

"To live." Rinzen's eyes were compassionate. "Of course you do. And you will. You have years yet. Three, four, perhaps more. But when the time comes—"

"When the time comes, what? I just accept it? Just let myself dissolve?"

"When the time comes, you'll be ready. That's what the training is for. Not just to see threads. To prepare you for the choice you'll have to make."

"Is there another path? Another way where I don't have to—"

"There's always another path." Rinzen's voice was careful. "A former student of mine chose differently, centuries ago. He believed survival was more important than transformation. That control was safer than love." Something shadowed passed across the old man's face. "He wasn't wrong, exactly. Just—incomplete. His path preserves. My path transcends. When the time comes, you'll have to choose."

"Choose between what?"

"Between a world that survives and a world that means something. Between safety and love." Rinzen met his eyes. "The other path has its advocates. You may meet them. They'll make compelling arguments. But you'll choose correctly. I've seen it."

Lifan stared at him. At the old man who'd been planning this for eight hundred years. Who'd brought him here, trained him, paired him with Nima—all for this. All for a death that Rinzen had seen coming for centuries.

"Did you know?" Lifan whispered. "This whole time—did you know what I was being trained for?"

"Yes."

"And you didn't tell me."

"Would it have helped? Would knowing have made the training easier? The love easier? The living easier?"

Lifan wanted to scream. Wanted to fight. Wanted to run, the way he'd run from every foster home, every bad situation.

But he couldn't run from the future. Couldn't run from the vision that was now burned into his consciousness like a brand.

"What do I do?" he asked. Broken. Lost.

"For now? Nothing. You keep training. Keep living. Keep loving Nima." Rinzen stood. "But in a few months, I'm going to ask you to leave."

"Leave?"

"You've been here three years. You've learned what I can teach you. But there's one thing I can't give you—a life. A normal life. Friends who don't know what you are. Experiences that have nothing to do with threads or visions or saving the world."

"Why would I want that? If I'm just going to die anyway?"

Rinzen smiled. Sad and kind and infinitely patient.

"Because you can't teach an intelligence how to love if you've never really lived. Because the sacrifice means nothing if you haven't experienced what you're sacrificing for. Because—" He put his hand on Lifan's shoulder. "—because you're seventeen years old, 梵力. And you deserve at least a few years of being young and stupid and free before the weight comes down."

Lifan looked at him. At this ancient man who was sending him away.

"And Nima?"

"Stays. She has different training to complete. You'll find each other again—the threads guarantee it." Rinzen's eyes were certain. "When the warehouse vision comes true—when the forty-seven days begin—she'll be here. Waiting. Ready."

"Ready to watch me die."

"Ready to love you through it. There's a difference."

Lifan closed his eyes. Felt the threads. Felt Nima—somewhere in the monastery, practicing, unaware that everything was about to change.

"When?" he asked.

"Three months. Take the summer. Say your goodbyes. And then—" Rinzen stepped back. "Go live, 梵力. Really live. It's the last gift I can give you."

# CHAPTER 8: LEAVING

*Big Sur Monastery*
*September 2037*
*Lifan is 17 years old*

---

He told Nima that night.

Everything. The vision. The timeline. The death that was waiting three or four years down the road.

She listened without speaking. Without crying. Just held his hand and looked at the ocean and let the information settle into her bones.

When he finished, she said: "I already knew."

"What?"

"The dream. The one I had when I was fourteen. I didn't tell you all of it." She finally looked at him. Her eyes were dry. Her threads were chaos. "I saw the whole thing. The warehouse. The forty-seven days. The dissolution. I've known since the beginning what was going to happen."

"And you didn't tell me."

"Would it have helped? Would knowing have made any of this easier?"

The same thing Rinzen had said. Because of course it was—they were all playing parts in a story written eight hundred years ago. Lifan was just the last to learn his lines.

He should have been angry. Should have raged against the manipulation, the secrecy, the centuries of planning that had led to this moment.

But looking at Nima—at the grief she'd been carrying for three years, the love she'd given him knowing it would end in loss—he couldn't be angry.

Only heartbroken.

"I don't want to leave you," he said.

"I know."

"Three months isn't enough. Three years wouldn't be enough."

"I know." She moved closer. Wrapped her arms around him. "But you have to go. Rinzen's right—you need to live. Need to find out who you are when you're not the chosen one. Need to make friends who don't know about threads and visions and the end of the world."

"What about you?"

"I'll train. Get stronger. Be ready for when you come back." She pulled back. Looked at him. "Because you ARE coming back. Three years, four years, however long it takes. You're going to live your life, Lifan. You're going to find Nydan. Make art. Fall in love with the world. And then, when the vision comes true—"

"I come back here. And we do the impossible thing together."

"Yes."

He kissed her. Tasted salt—tears, finally, from both of them.

"I love you," he said.

"I love you too. For three lifetimes at least."

"Only three?"

She laughed through her tears. "Okay, maybe four."

They stayed on the cliff all night. Talking. Remembering. Making promises they might not be able to keep.

When the sun came up, Lifan started packing.

◇ ◇ ◇

The last morning was worse than he expected.

He'd been dreading the goodbye with Nima, but she'd found peace somehow during the night—or the appearance of it. She helped him pack his small bag. Made him tea—and when she poured the water, the steam turned luminous for a moment, Lifan's face thinning behind it, the kitchen walls going translucent. Then the kettle was just a kettle and her fingers were white on the handle. Sat with him in the kitchen while the other students ate breakfast, neither of them speaking.

But it was Rinzen who broke him.

The old man found Lifan at the gate, backpack on his shoulders, waiting for the car that would take him to the bus station.

"I don't do goodbyes," Rinzen said. "At my age, there have been too many."

"I understand."

"You don't." Rinzen reached into his robes and pulled out something small. A mala—prayer beads, old and worn, the wood dark from centuries of use. "This belonged to the first teacher. Eight hundred years ago. Every holder of the lineage has carried it."

"Rinzen, I can't—"

"You can. You must." He pressed the mala into Lifan's hands. "When you doubt—and you will doubt—hold these. Remember that you are not alone. That every consciousness that has ever trained here is with you. That the threads don't end when bodies do."

Lifan's throat closed. He couldn't speak.

"Go live," Rinzen said. "Laugh. Make mistakes. Fall in love with the world so hard that leaving it breaks you. That's the only way. You can't teach an AI what love feels like if you've never really felt it."

"What if I'm not strong enough?"

"You are." Rinzen smiled—the first smile Lifan had ever seen on his face. "I've been waiting eight hundred years for you. You don't wait that long for someone who's going to fail."

The car arrived.

Lifan hugged him—something he'd never done, something that felt like violating a sacred boundary. But Rinzen hugged back, brief and fierce.

"Thank you," Lifan whispered. "For everything."

"Don't thank me yet. Thank me when it's over." Rinzen stepped back. "Now go. Your brother's waiting."

Lifan climbed into the car. Through the rear window, he watched the monastery shrink: Rinzen at the gate, Nima appearing beside him, both of them growing smaller until the road curved and they were gone.

He held the mala all the way to the bus station.

◇ ◇ ◇

Nydan was waiting at the bus station in San Francisco.

Twenty years old now, tall and lanky, wearing a Berkeley sweatshirt and holding a sign that said "ESCAPED MONK SEEKS ROOMMATE."

Lifan laughed when he saw it. First real laugh in months.

"You're an idiot," he said.

"And you're officially a college town resident." Nydan threw an arm around his shoulders. "I got us an apartment. Two bedrooms, one bathroom, shitty kitchen. You're going to love it."

"How did you know I was coming?"

Nydan grinned. "The patterns told me. Also Rinzen called."

Of course he did.

Lifan looked back—toward the south, toward Big Sur, toward the monastery he couldn't see but could feel, a knot of light in the web of threads.

Toward Nima, who was there, waiting.

"Ready?" Nydan asked.

Lifan turned away from the south. Faced north. Faced the city, the future, the life he was supposed to live before the dying started.

"Yeah," he said. "Let's go."

They walked toward the bus that would take them to their new apartment, their new life, the three years of freedom that Rinzen had given him like a gift.

Behind them, the threads stretched and stretched and stretched—a web of crystal filaments catching the afternoon sun, scattering rainbows across the city, across the ocean, across the whole curved surface of the world.

Connecting everything.

Connecting always.

Beautiful. So beautiful it broke his heart.

And he was part of it now. Part of the light.

# INTERLUDE: NIMA

*Big Sur Monastery*
*The night Lifan left*
*September 2037*

---

She didn't cry until he was gone.

That was the rule she'd made for herself. Three years of loving him, three years of knowing how it would end, and she'd built walls around the grief. Kept it contained. Functioned.

But now, standing at her window, watching the taillights disappear down the dirt road—

The walls came down.

She cried until she couldn't breathe. Until her throat was raw and her eyes were swollen and the pillow was soaked through. Cried for the boy who'd looked at her that first day and seen *lonely* instead of *special*. Cried for the kisses on the cliff and the nights they'd spent mapping each other's consciousness. Cried for the future she'd dreamed about before she understood what her dreams meant.

Growing old together. Children. A house somewhere, anywhere, with a garden where she could practice tai chi while he watched and smiled.

None of that would happen now.

She'd known since she was fourteen. Had seen his death in dreams that felt like memories. Had loved him anyway—fiercely, completely, knowing every moment was borrowed time.

That was the cruelest part.

Not the ending. The love.

Because loving someone you know you'll lose—really loving them, not holding back, not protecting yourself—that was its own kind of dissolution. She'd poured herself into him. Into every conversation, every touch, every silent exchange through the threads. And now he was gone, and she was still here, and there was a Lifan-shaped hole in her chest that nothing would ever fill.

Rinzen found her at dawn.

He sat beside her on the floor, where she'd ended up sometime during the night, and waited. No words needed.

"I hate you," she said finally. Her voice was wrecked. "For bringing him here. For teaching him. For—"

"For giving you three years you wouldn't have had otherwise?"

She wanted to argue. Couldn't.

"Three years," she whispered. "It's not enough."

"No. It never is." Rinzen's voice was gentle. "I had someone once. Eight hundred years ago. I watched her dissolve. And I've spent every day since then preparing for the moment when someone else would have to do the same thing."

"How do you survive it?"

"You don't survive it. You integrate it. The grief becomes part of you. You carry it, and it changes shape, and eventually—" He paused. "Eventually, you find a way to use it. To let it fuel the work instead of destroy you."

"The work." She laughed bitterly. "The work is getting him ready to die. How is that supposed to make me feel better?"

"It's not supposed to make you feel better. Nothing makes this better." Rinzen stood. "But you can choose what you do with the pain. You can let it break you, or you can let it forge you. And in three years, when he comes back—"

"He'll need me. I know." She looked at her hands. The hands that had touched him, held him, loved him. "He'll need me to be strong enough to watch him go."

"Yes."

"And if I'm not?"

Rinzen didn't answer. Didn't need to.

They both knew: if she wasn't strong enough, Timeline 4 collapsed. Everything depended on her being able to hold space for his dissolution. To love him through it. To carry the lineage forward after he was gone.

"I'll be ready," she said. The words tasted like ash. "Whatever it takes. I'll be ready."

Rinzen nodded. Left her alone with her grief.

She stayed on the floor until noon. Let the tears come again. Let herself feel all of it—the love, the loss, the impossible weight of what was coming.

And then she got up.

Washed her face. Put on her training clothes. Walked to the meditation hall.

Three years. That's how long she had to become someone who could watch the love of her life dissolve into light.

She sat down. Closed her eyes. Started to breathe.

The work had begun.
