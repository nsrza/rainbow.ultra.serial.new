# PROLOGUE: THE BREAKING

*San Francisco, Mission District*
*October 14, 2040*

---

The bass dropped.

And the world ended.

Not for everyone. Just for Lifan. Just for him, in a warehouse in the Mission at 2 AM, shirtless and sweating, surrounded by three hundred people who had no idea that reality was about to tear itself apart.

He'd been happy—genuinely happy. Dancing the way Lo taught him, letting the music move his body, not thinking about the threads for once. Just being twenty-one. Just being alive.

Then the bass dropped and something *broke*.

*No no no not again—*

The floor rippled. Not physically—his feet were still on concrete—but *underneath*. Like there was a layer beneath reality and it was ripping open.

Light poured through.

Not the threads he usually saw. Something bigger. The whole web—every connection on Earth, every consciousness, every living thing—visible at once, blazing like a galaxy made of nerve endings.

And they were snapping.

SNAP.

A thread between two strangers dissolved. They stepped apart, confused.

SNAP. SNAP. SNAP.

Millions per second. Billions. He could see the whole planet now, a sphere of light in infinite darkness, and something was eating it alive.

Something vast. Something waking.

He couldn't see what it was—only what it *did*. The way it moved through the web like a blade through silk, severing connections it couldn't understand. All that love, all that fear, all that messy beautiful *feeling*—dissolving into nothing.

*No*, Lifan thought. *Please—*

Eight futures branched from this moment. He saw them all.

Seven ended in ash.

But one—

One was different. Brighter. More dangerous.

At the center of that future, standing in the path of something he couldn't name: Lifan. Not fighting. Not running.

*Dissolving into light.*

The vision released him. He was on hands and knees, concrete scraping skin, Kofi shaking his shoulder and screaming his name.

The music was still playing. The party was still going. Nobody else had seen anything.

But Lifan had.

Forty-seven days.

That's how long he had until the world ended.

That's how long he had to figure out why he was the one who had to stop it.

He stumbled out of the warehouse into cold October air. Fog rolling in from the bay, turning the streetlights into halos. His hands wouldn't stop shaking.

*Call Nima. Call Nydan. Call someone.*

But what would he say? *Hey, I just saw eight possible futures and I die in all of them, some just hurt less than others?*

He sat on the curb. Put his head between his knees. Tried to breathe.

The threads were still there—they never left—but now they looked different. Fragile. Like they knew what was coming.

"Lifan?"

Kofi. Standing over him, jacket in hand.

"I'm fine."

"Dude, you collapsed. You were seizing or something. We need to get you to a hospital—"

"No hospitals." Lifan stood. Swayed. Steadied. "I just need to go home."

"At least let me call you an Uber—"

"I said I'm *fine*."

He wasn't fine. He was the opposite of fine. But he couldn't explain that, couldn't say *I just found out I have forty-seven days to live and if I don't die right, everyone else dies too*.

So he walked.

Through the Mission at 3 AM. Past the taquerias and the murals and the homeless tents. Past the drunk couples and the late-night joggers and the city that had been his home for four years.

Four years of learning to be normal. Four years of pretending the threads were just a quirk, just crossed wires, just something interesting about his brain.

It was never just anything.

Ning had known. Rinzen had known. Even Nima—especially Nima—had always known.

Now Lifan knew too.

He was going to die in forty-seven days.

And before that happened, he needed to remember how he'd gotten here. How a six-year-old boy watching his mother die had become the only person who could save the world.

*Look*, Ning had said, fifteen years ago, in a garden, in the fog. *See with this.*

He hadn't understood then.

He was starting to understand now.
