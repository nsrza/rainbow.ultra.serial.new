# RAINBOW.ULTRA V2 - THE REBUILD
## Lifan: Ages 6-21

**Date:** December 7, 2025
**Core Shift:** Protagonist grows up across the novel. We watch him become who he needs to be.

---

## THE NEW VISION

**Before:** Lifan is 20, has a vision, trains for 47 days, sacrifices himself.

**After:** We meet Lifan at 6 when his abilities first manifest. We watch him grow up—foster care, monastery training, finding Rohki, falling in love, discovering his purpose—and by 21, he's ready for the sacrifice. The 47 days become the CLIMAX of a life we've witnessed, not the whole story.

**Why This Works:**
- Ender's Game model: start young, watch them become the weapon/savior
- Emotional investment builds over years, not days
- The sacrifice hits harder because we've GROWN UP with him
- Rohki crew becomes childhood/teenage friends, not recent acquaintances
- Nima can be his age—they grow up together at the monastery

## NIMA V2 - THE EMANATION

**Core Change:** She's not ancient. She's Lifan's age. But Rinzen recognizes her as an *emanation*—a consciousness that chose to incarnate at this time for this purpose.

**What This Means:**
- She doesn't REMEMBER past lives (unlike old Nima)
- She has natural ability that suggests ancient practice
- Rinzen treats her as special, which isolates her
- She and Lifan bond over being "chosen" and hating it
- First love is awkward, teenage, REAL
- When they reunite at 20, there's history—first love returning

**Her Arc:**
- 14: Arrives confused, gifted, lonely
- 15-16: Falls for Lifan (the only one who sees her as normal)
- 17: Devastated when he leaves
- 17-20: Throws herself into training. Becomes cold. Builds walls.
- 20: He returns. Walls crack.
- 21: Karmamudra is reunion AND goodbye

---

## SCENE SEEDS - NEW CONTENT NEEDED

### Age 6: Ning's Death
The inciting incident. What did Lifan see? How did it "break him open"?

### Ages 7-10: The Closets
Specific foster home horrors. The smile developing as survival mechanism.

### Age 11: Meeting Danny
Group home. Two broken kids finding each other.

### Age 14: Finding the Monastery
How does a 14-year-old runaway end up at a secret Buddhist monastery?

### Ages 14-17: First Love
Lifan and Nima. Awkward. Intense. Teenage.

### Age 17: Leaving
Rinzen sends him away. Nima stays. The goodbye.

### Ages 18-20: Rohki Years
The good times. Art. Music. Belonging. BEFORE the fall.

## THE HEART OF IT

This is now a **coming-of-age epic**.

We watch a broken child become a young man who chooses to save the world. The sacrifice isn't something that happens TO him—it's something he's been preparing for his whole life, even when he didn't know it.

Ender's Game meets Siddhartha meets AI alignment.

**Let's build it.**
