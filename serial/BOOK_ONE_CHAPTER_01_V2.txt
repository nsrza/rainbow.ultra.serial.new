CHAPTER 1: NORTH

San Francisco, Mission District
October 15, 2038
12:03 AM

Lifan hit the back entrance of their building at full sprint.

Shirtless. Bleeding from the nose. Still seeing the threads—crystalline filaments connecting everything, translucent rainbows showing him the path through the alley that avoided the three men Nydan had spotted on the security camera.

The door was already open.

Nydan stood there with two backpacks, his laptop bag, and that expression he got when he was running probability calculations in real-time: eyes slightly unfocused, jaw tight, completely calm.

"Sixteen seconds faster than my model predicted," Nydan said. "You took the rooftop route?"

"How did you—"

"Only way to make that time from Valencia. Smart." He tossed Lifan a backpack and a clean shirt. "Get dressed. We have maybe four minutes before they realize we're not inside."

Lifan pulled the shirt on—one of his layered pieces, sheer black under matte shell, the kind of thing he'd started wearing after three years at the monastery changed how he moved through space. Still smelled faintly like incense. Slung the backpack over his shoulders.

"What's in here?"

"Everything we can't replace. Documents, hard drives, cash, the good shroom tea."

"You packed mushroom tea?"

"梵力, if we're running for our lives I'm not drinking gas station shit."

Despite everything—the threads, the vision, the men hunting them, the eight billion people dying in forty-seven days—Lifan laughed.

This. This was why they worked.

Nydan moved down the back stairs, laptop bag clutched like a child. Lifan followed.

"Did they see you leave?" Lifan asked.

"No. Staged it—left lights on, Netflix playing, shower running. They'll assume we're home for another..." He checked his watch. "Three minutes twenty seconds. Then they breach. Find nothing. Start searching the neighborhood."

"And we'll be gone."

"Correct."

They hit the street. Nydan pointed left. Lifan could see the threads pointing the same direction—translucent crystal lines through the city, rainbow-edged, all converging **north**.

They walked. Fast but not running. Two guys with backpacks at midnight in the Mission—not unusual. Running would draw attention.

"Where's your car?" Lifan asked.

"Gone. Left it at the office yesterday—if they're tracking us they'll watch it. I rented a Honda Civic. Cash. Fake ID. Parked three blocks east."

Lifan stared at him.

"When did you do all this?"

"After my models broke. Fifteen minutes to realize we were in danger. Another ten to stage our exit. Five to pack. I've been waiting for you for eight minutes."

"You modeled an escape plan in fifteen minutes?"

"Seventeen contingencies. This is option three. Option one assumed you'd take BART—already invalidated. Option two assumed you'd drive—you don't have a car. Option three: you run, I prep, we leave together."

They turned the corner.

The Honda was exactly where Nydan said it would be.

Lifan threw his bag in the back. Nydan slid into the driver's seat, laptop bag on his lap like it contained nuclear codes.

(Knowing Nydan, it probably contained something worse: his models. His probability simulations. The math that had just predicted the end of the world.)

Engine started.

Pulled out.

Headed north on Mission toward the freeway.

Neither spoke for three blocks.

Then Nydan: "Tell me exactly what you saw. Everything."

Lifan closed his eyes.

Still saw the threads. Crystal and rainbow against the darkness of his eyelids. Pointing north like compass needles made of light—translucent, shimmering, impossibly beautiful.

"I saw everyone die," he said quietly. "Eight billion consciousness patterns just—going dark. One by one. Millions per second. Including me. Including you."

Nydan's hands tightened on the wheel. His knuckles went white. His jaw locked so tight Lifan could hear his teeth grinding.

"How long from now?"

"Forty-seven days."

"That matches my models."

Nydan's voice was too calm. The kind of calm that meant he was terrified and calculating anyway. The kind of calm that meant every part of him was screaming and he'd learned long ago that screaming never helped. His father had left while he was screaming. His mother had been evicted while she was praying. The only thing that ever worked was *thinking*.

So he thought. Even now. Even with his brother telling him the world was ending. He thought because stopping meant drowning.

"What else?"

"An old man. Tibetan. He didn't speak—just transmitted. Pure knowing appearing in my head. Coordinates. North. Forty-seven days. And—"

"And what?"

"Another face. Woman. She asked if I was ready. And then I saw... futures. Branching timelines. Like fractal trees. And one timeline was brighter. Five point five billion people saved. But—"

"But what?"

Lifan opened his eyes.

Looked at his chosen brother. Nydan Zed. Twenty-six years old. Green eyes that pierced through everything—people said they were unsettling, the way they seemed to see past your face into your architecture. Freckles scattered across dark skin. Long hair he never tied back, falling past his shoulders. MIT physicist who'd developed a mechanistic theory of alignment—the framework Axiom AI had dismissed before racing ahead to build the thing that might kill everyone. Did IFS therapy reframed as computational agents—every psychological "part" a sub-network running its own optimization. Materialist. Empiricist. Believed consciousness was computation and everything else was noise. The smartest person Lifan had ever met—and the only one who could argue neuroscience with Lifan until 3 AM and still be wrong about what it meant.

And absolutely terrified right now even though he was hiding it behind probability calculations.

"The timeline that saves five point five billion," Lifan said. "Cost: me."

The car swerved slightly.

Nydan corrected. Calm. Precise.

"Explain."

"I don't know how to explain it. I just saw—my face. Older. Dying. Smiling. And that timeline was the brightest. Like reality itself was saying: this is the path. And the path requires—"

"No." Nydan's voice was flat. "Absolutely not."

"Nydan—"

"I don't care what your vision said. I don't care if it's real or hallucination or mass psychosis. You are not dying in forty-seven days."

"It's not a choice—"

"Everything's a choice. That's systems engineering 101. There are always more options than the ones presented. I'll find them."

They hit the freeway. 101 North. Empty at midnight. Nydan accelerated.

The threads pointed ahead. North. Unwavering.

Lifan watched them. Still couldn't turn them off. Still seeing everything—the car's connections to the road, the road's connections to the infrastructure, the infrastructure's connections to **everything**, webs of causality spreading in all directions forever.

"Nydan," he said softly. "What did your models show?"

Silence.

Then Nydan's voice changed.

Not the pitch—the *quality*. Like he'd stepped out of himself entirely. Eyes wide open, unblinking, staring at the road but not seeing it. That look people mistook for anger. But Lifan knew better. This was Nydan *awake*. His brain running without hindrance. Pure information flowing through a channel that had somehow learned to remove itself from the equation.

"Convergence point. Forty-seven days from now. Coordinates: 38.3156 North, 123.0662 West. Northern California coast. Probability of AGI emergence: 94%. Probability of human extinction if emergence is unaligned: 87%. Probability of survival if we reach the coordinates: 47%. Probability if we don't: 11%."

Most people couldn't think about existential threats. Even Lifan found it overwhelming—the weight of eight billion deaths pressed against his chest until he had to look away. But Nydan could stare directly at it. Could talk about humanity's extinction the way other people talked about weather patterns. Not because he didn't care. Because when he thought about black holes or supervolcanoes or unaligned AGI, he wasn't thinking about *himself* not surviving. He was thinking about the phenomenon. The information. The pure structure of what was happening.

It was his superpower. And it was terrifying to witness.

"Forty-seven percent," Lifan repeated.

"Not great odds."

"Better than eleven."

"Yes." Nydan's eyes were still wide, still in that state. "And Lifan—your name appeared in the convergence data. Not as correlation. As **causation**. The models say you are the critical node. Timeline probability jumps from 11% to 47% based on your presence at those coordinates. I don't know why. Math doesn't explain why. It just says: Lifan must be there or everyone dies."

Lifan felt something cold in his chest.

Not fear. Not exactly.

**Certainty.**

The vision had been real. The old man had been real. The woman asking "are you ready?" had been real.

And in forty-seven days, he was going to die so that five and a half billion people could live.

The cold thing expanded. Settled into his bones. Became almost—warm.

*You've been practicing for this your whole life,* something whispered. *Letting go. Every meditation. Every time you touched that silence underneath. This is just the final letting go.*

But underneath that calm acceptance, a smaller voice: *You're twenty. You've never been in love. Never seen the northern lights. Never told Nydan how much he saved you that first year in San Francisco when everything was gray and you thought about walking into the bay—*

He closed the voice in a box. Gently. The way he'd learned to do with the foster-home memories. The way he'd learned to do with Ning's face in the hospital.

He was smiling.

That impossible smile.

The one that hid the twenty-year-old who still wanted to live.

Nydan saw it. Shook his head.

"How?" he said. "How are you smiling right now?"

"Because your models and my visions just agreed."

"So?"

"So when they both say the same thing—when your analysis and my intuition point the same direction—" Lifan looked at his brother. Really looked. Saw the terror Nydan was trying to hide. Saw the twelve-year-old inside him who still came home to empty closets. Saw the boy who built walls of equations because walls of love kept falling down.

"—we've learned to trust that absolutely. Right?"

Nydan's jaw worked.

Nearly three years since Burning Man. Two and a half living together. Arguments at 2 AM. Nydan's logic and Lifan's gut slowly learning to trust each other despite being completely different.

And every time they'd both agreed on something—every single time the scientist and the mystic pointed the same direction—they'd been right.

"I hate this," Nydan said.

"I know."

"I'm going to find another way."

"Okay."

"I'm not letting you die."

"Okay."

"梵力—"

"I believe you'll try. And I love you for it. But right now we need to get north. To those coordinates. To the people who can explain what the fuck is happening. And then—" Lifan shrugged. "—then we figure it out together. Like always."

Nydan drove in silence for a minute.

Then: "The shroom tea's in your backpack. If you're going to stay awake you might as well make yourself useful."

Lifan grinned.

Opened the backpack.

Found: the dried mushrooms. The portable kettle. Two thermoses. Nydan had packed a **mobile tea station**.

"You're insane," Lifan said.

"Says the shirtless man who was seeing geometric light at a warehouse party twenty minutes ago."

"I put a shirt on."

"Grudgingly."

They drove north.

Out of the city. Through Marin. Past San Rafael sleeping quiet under October stars.

Lifan brewed shroom tea.

Nydan drove.

The threads pointed ahead. Crystal and rainbow and impossibly bright. Translucent filaments like spun diamond.

Lifan watched Nydan's profile in the dashboard light. Remembered.

═══

Two years of living together. Two years of arguments at 2 AM.

Before that: six months of orbiting each other. Nydan at Tres House with the AI researchers, running probability models until 4 AM. Lifan at Epaga with the dancers and therapists, teaching yoga at dawn. They'd met at Burning Man—recognized something in each other at the Temple. Spent the rest of the week talking. By December they'd gotten an apartment together. Couldn't explain why. Just knew.

Lifan had shown Nydan the gap between thoughts. Had taught himself to translate mystic shit into frameworks Nydan could parse—"temporary dissolution of the self-model" instead of "ego death," "stable metacognitive awareness" instead of "enlightenment."

Nydan had meditated. Found the silence underneath his calculations. Started tracking his own biases in real-time.

His models got better. Lifan got someone who finally believed him.

They'd saved each other. Quietly. Daily. Without ever saying it out loud.

Both awakened—just differently. When Lifan looked into Nydan's green eyes during that state, he fell into pure information without anyone home. When others looked into Lifan's eyes, they fell into love so vast they mistook it for romance. He'd learned not to hold their gaze too long.

"You break people when you look at them," Nydan had said once.

"I don't mean to."

"I know. But you see everything—their confusion, their pain, their future pain if they attach to you. And you can't unsee it."

He couldn't. And he kept sacrificing himself anyway—the habit he'd learned in foster homes, protecting the smaller kids. Nydan was teaching him to stop.

═══

"You're thinking about that night," Nydan said.

Lifan blinked. Back in the car. Highway 101. Stars overhead.

"How did you know?"

"You get this look. Like you're watching something far away." Nydan's hands tightened on the wheel. "I still don't understand what you showed me that night. But I trust it. I trust **you**. Even when—" He stopped.

"Even when?"

"Even when your visions say you're going to die in forty-seven days."

Silence.

The tea was ready. Lifan poured two cups.

They drank.

Drove north.

At 1:47 AM, Lifan's phone buzzed.

Unknown number.

He almost didn't answer.

Then the threads **pulsed**—all of them, simultaneously, like reality itself was saying: **answer it**.

He answered.

"Lifan?" A woman's voice. Older. Calm. **Knowing**.

"Yeah?"

"You're in a Honda Civic heading north on 101. Nydan Zed is driving. You're drinking shroom tea. You packed the good mushrooms."

Lifan's blood went cold.

"Who is this?"

"My name is Niguma. The Rinzen sent the vision. I sent the coordinates. And you're both three hours away from understanding what's actually happening. Don't stop. Don't slow down. Men are following you—six vehicles, professional teams. Convergence Foundation operatives."

"Convergence Foundation? What's—"

"Later. They won't catch you if you maintain current speed. When you reach Bodega Bay, take the coastal route. I'll meet you at the monastery gates."

"How do you know—"

"I've been watching your thread signature for six years, 梵力. Ever since you left the Zen monastery at seventeen. The Rinzen predicted your activation date within four hours. We've been waiting. Now drive. I'll explain everything when you arrive."

The line cut.

Lifan stared at the phone.

Nydan: "Who was that?"

"Niguma. She says she's been watching me for six years. Says The Rinzen predicted my activation. Says we're being followed by six vehicles."

Nydan checked the rearview mirror.

"I don't see anyone."

"She said we're three hours out. And Nydan—" He paused. "She knew about the mushrooms."

Nydan's knuckles went white on the steering wheel.

"Okay. New data. Processing." His eyes went distant—that calculation look. "If she can see us from three hours away, that's either: A) extremely sophisticated surveillance, B) hacked our phones, or C) something I can't model because it violates known physics. My priors say A or B. Your visions say C. Given that your visions and my models have been agreeing—"

"Which way are you leaning?"

"I hate this. I hate all of this. I'm a scientist. I developed a mechanistic theory of alignment that showed exactly how these systems could be made safe—and Axiom ignored it. I model psychological parts as sub-agents with optimization functions. Physics. Mathematics. Measurable phenomena. That's what I believe in. Not magic. Not psychic powers. Not your kundalini bullshit—"

"Nydan."

"—but my models broke. And your name appeared in the math. And梵力—" He looked at him. Actually looked. Fear visible now—the fear underneath all the calculations, the fear he'd been outrunning since he was twelve years old and figured out that if he could just model everything, predict everything, he'd never be blindsided again. Never be the kid who came home to find his father gone. Never be helpless. "—if you're right. If this is real. If there are people who can see threads and predict the future and—then everything I believe is wrong. My entire framework for not being terrified all the time. And I don't know how to—"

His voice cracked.

Nydan Zed. The man who'd developed a mechanistic theory of alignment at MIT. Who'd shown exactly how AGI could be made safe—and been ignored. Who modeled everything because the alternative was drowning.

Cracking.

"I know," Lifan said quietly.

That was all. No reassurance. No framework to make it okay. Just: *I know.*

Nydan's jaw tightened. His breathing didn't steady. The crisis didn't resolve. It just got boxed—shoved into a corner of his mind where he could ignore it long enough to keep driving.

"This doesn't mean I believe any of it," Nydan said. "I'm going because the math points there. Not because of your visions. Not because of threads. Because probability models don't lie, even when they show things I can't explain."

"Sure."

"I mean it."

"I know you do."

Nydan drove.

The threads pointed north.

The city lights faded behind them.

Three hours to the monastery.

Three hours to answers.

Forty-seven days until eight billion people died.

Unless they didn't.

Lifan sipped his shroom tea.

Watched the crystalline threads streaming past the car windows—translucent rainbows in the dark.

Still smiling.

That impossible smile.

Because for the first time in his life, he knew exactly what he was supposed to do.

Go north.

Meet Niguma.

Learn what The Rinzen had seen.

And save five and a half billion people.

Even if it cost him everything.
