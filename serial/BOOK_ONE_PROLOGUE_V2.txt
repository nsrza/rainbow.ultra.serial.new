PROLOGUE: THE PATTERN

San Francisco, Mission District

Lifan was dying.

Or having the best night of his life.

Hard to tell.

The music had been normal twenty seconds ago. A Dua Lipa house remix at some warehouse party off Valencia. His OEDI coworkers had dragged him out—Mei and Amara and Kofi, all insisting he needed to LIVE—and he'd agreed because honestly, he liked dancing.

Liked the way his body moved. Three years of monastery training (age 14 to 17, after Ning died, before foster care finally released him) had left him with something that made people stare—like his body had its own geometry. Clean lines. Precise angles. Something hypnotic about the way he moved through space.

He'd taken his shirt off an hour ago. Too hot in the warehouse.

Kofi leaned close, shouting over the music: "Dude, you know like three girls have asked me for your number, right?"

Lifan blinked. "What?"

"You seriously don't notice? The way people look at you?"

Lifan genuinely hadn't.

He'd been watching the **music**.

Because music did something nobody else could see.

The bass was blooming—deep indigo expanding outward in concentric rings. The synths were weaving gold and silver threads through the air, braiding themselves into helixes that pulsed with the beat. The hi-hats scattered like sparks, tiny white fractals multiplying and dissolving. The whole room was alive with geometry—shapes that breathed, colors that sang, patterns folding through dimensions that shouldn't exist.

He'd been seeing this since Ning died. Since he was six and watched something impossible happen and his brain broke open in ways therapists couldn't close.

Four therapists. Two hospitalizations. One foster mother who'd locked him in a closet when he talked about the lights. *You're making it up. You're sick. You're wrong.*

He'd learned to hide it. Learned to smile and nod and pretend he was normal. Learned to box the seeing away until it was safe.

But the seeing never stopped. The seeing was always there, waiting beneath his skin like something that wanted out.

Nydan said it was synesthesia. Lifan said it was kundalini. They'd been arguing about it for three years—ever since Burning Man, ever since they'd become roommates, ever since they'd realized they were brothers in every way that mattered.

Nydan was probably home right now. Running models. Sipping his lion's mane and psilocybin microdose tea—what he called "neurogenesis in a cup." Said the studies showed 23% improvement in pattern recognition. Nydan had studies for everything.

Lifan lifted his hands and traced the patterns in the air. The music's geometry. Looked insane. Looked like he was conducting an orchestra only he could hear.

Kofi was filming: "This is going on the OEDI Slack, you weirdo—"

The bass dropped.

And something **broke**.

Not the music.

Something else.

Something **fundamental**.

Lifan had time for one thought—*not again not again Ning please not again*—before his childhood tore open and swallowed him whole.

The warehouse floor rippled. Not physically—Lifan could still feel the concrete under his feet—but **underneath** that. Like there was a layer beneath reality and it was **tearing**.

And through the tear: threads.

Thousands of them. Millions. Gossamer filaments of light connecting everything to everything else—person to person, person to music, person to the walls, to the city, to the sky. Silver and gold and colors he couldn't name, a web so dense and beautiful it made him want to weep.

And they were **snapping**.

One by one.

**SNAP.**

A thread connecting Mei to the music severed. She stumbled, looked confused.

**SNAP. SNAP. SNAP.**

More threads breaking. The room was full of them—webs of connection he'd never seen this clearly before—and they were dissolving like silk in fire.

He could see **people** differently now.

Mei's body had dissolved into golden light—anxiety spiraling at her chest like a small sun eating itself.

Kofi was blue geometry. Recursive. Algorithmic. His thoughts visible as branching fractals.

Amara was red exhaustion reaching toward Lifan like vines seeking light.

And the threads connecting them—connecting **everyone**—were breaking.

Not just here.

**Everywhere.**

He could feel the breaks spreading. Across the city. The continent. The **planet**.

His vision exploded outward—

Eight billion people blazing into his awareness. Not abstract. **Specific**. He could see them: a woman in São Paulo nursing her daughter, an old man in Kyoto tending bonsai, teenagers in Lagos laughing at a phone screen, a child in Mumbai reaching for her mother's hand—all of them luminous, all of them **real**, eight billion individual flames burning in the dark—

Each one a universe. Each one someone's everything. Each one as real as Ning had been real, as alive as Ning had been alive—

*Ning on the hospital bed. Ning's hand going cold. Ning's light scattering into patterns he couldn't follow—*

And then going out.

One by one.

Then thousands at once.

Then millions.

The lights collapsing inward like stars dying, like the universe running backward, like watching every candle in existence snuffed by the same wind—

**Everyone dying.**

**Including him.**

His body reacted—dropped into horse stance, knees bent, center of gravity lowering, monastery training kicking in: *when everything breaks, root yourself*—

And in that moment—body locked in perfect structural integrity while his mind **shattered**—

The darkness split open.

Color poured through—impossible color, colors that didn't exist, ultraviolet bleeding into infrared, the spectrum folding back on itself. And in that color: a face.

Old. Tibetan. Eyes like black holes rimmed with rainbow light.

The face didn't speak. It **transmitted**—knowledge burning directly into Lifan's mind like lightning etching glass:

> **北方。快来。47天。**
> *North. Come now. Forty-seven days.*

Coordinates seared into his memory. Clifftop. Ocean. North.

The vision kaleidoscoped—

Another face erupting from the color-storm: woman, ageless, fierce, silver hair whipping in a wind that didn't exist. She looked at him with recognition that cracked something open in his chest—

> **你准备好了吗？**
> *Are you ready?*

Then his own face—older, dying, **smiling**—and behind it: futures.

Thousands of them. Millions. Branching and splitting and recombining like lightning frozen mid-strike, like a river delta seen from space, like every choice ever made visible at once. Most of them dim. Dying. But one path burning bright—

> **Five point five billion saved. Cost: you.**

Then everything **inverted**.

The dying stopped.

The threads rebuilt.

Everyone lived.

But only if—

**"LIFAN!"**

The warehouse snapped back.

Music playing.

People dancing.

Mei shaking him—hands on his bare skin: "Jesus CHRIST, you were seizing! Are you okay?"

He touched his face.

Blood from his nose.

Tears streaming.

And he could still **see** them.

The threads.

The patterns.

**Everything.**

It hadn't turned off.

"I'm okay," he whispered.

He was smiling.

That impossible smile. The one he'd perfected in foster homes. The one that said *I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine* while everything inside him screamed.

His hands were shaking. His whole body was shaking. But the smile stayed. It always stayed. It was the only thing that ever stayed.

People were staring. Amara crying. Kofi terrified.

His phone buzzed.

He knew who it was before he looked.

**Nydan.**

Pulled away from Mei, stumbled outside into the San Francisco night. Cold. October. He could see the city's threads now, silver and gold connections running through power lines and BART tunnels and **everything**.

Answered:

"梵力, don't panic." Nydan's voice. Calm. Precise. That analytical brain already three steps ahead—modeling contingencies, calculating exit vectors. "Are you at the warehouse party?"

"Yeah. How did you—"

"I need you to come home. Now. Don't take BART. Walk. Don't run—you'll look suspicious. Just walk."

"Nydan, what—"

"My models broke." For the first time in three years, Lifan heard fear in Nydan's voice. "All of them. Every probability simulation I've been running—AGI timelines, geopolitical scenarios, everything—just collapsed to a single point. Forty-seven days from now. Coordinates on the northern California coast. And梵力—"

"What?"

"Your name appeared in the output. Your **actual name**. 梵力陈. In the math. Which is impossible. Math doesn't know about people. But there it was. And then—"

Background noise: sirens, close.

"Nydan?"

"Someone's outside our apartment. Three men. Professional. I'm watching them on our security camera. They're good—almost didn't spot them. 梵力, I think we have maybe ten minutes before they breach. I'm staging an exit through the back but I need you here to grab what we can't lose."

Lifan was already running.

Down Valencia. Past late-night taquerias and closed bookstores. Moving **fast**—monastery training kicking in.

"What happened?" he gasped.

"I don't know. But twenty minutes ago my models changed. And梵力—did something happen to **you** tonight?"

"I saw—" How to explain? "—I saw everyone die. Eight billion people. All at once. And then I saw them live. And an old man told me to go north. And—"

Silence on the line.

Then: "Describe the man."

"Tibetan. Old. Eyes like—like he'd seen everything. And coordinates. Same ones your models showed?"

"38.3156 North, 123.0662 West."

"Yeah."

"Fuck." Nydan never swore.

Lifan's stomach dropped.

"I'm two blocks away," he said.

"Good. Back entrance. I'm packing our go-bags. We leave in five minutes."

"Where?"

"North. Where else?"

The line cut.

Lifan ran through the Mission. Shirtless, bleeding, terrified.

He could still see them.

The threads.

Silver and gold and impossibly bright.

All of them pointing **north**.

He was smiling.

That impossible smile.

Because Nydan's models and Lifan's visions had just agreed.

And when they both said the same thing?

You moved.
