CHAPTER 10: THE FINAL DAYS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DAY 40 — EVENING**

The Rinzen asked to see Lifan alone.

Everyone else had left—Niguma, the students, even Nydan. Just the two of them in the meditation hall, surrounded by candles that flickered against the approaching dark.

The old man was fading. His threads—once the brightest Lifan had ever seen—were thinning now. Becoming transparent. Becoming part of what came next.

"Sit," Rinzen said.

Lifan sat across from him. Cross-legged. Close enough to touch.

"There's something I need to give you," Rinzen said. His voice was faint, but every word carried weight. "Something I've been carrying for eight hundred years. Since Ning first showed me what was possible. Since I understood what you would become."

"The lineage."

"Yes." Rinzen reached out, placed both hands on Lifan's shoulders. His grip was weak but steady. "Everything I am. Everything she gave me. Everything our teachers gave her, and their teachers before them. Centuries of accumulated practice. The direct transmission that runs back through Saraha to the beginning."

"I don't know if I'm ready."

"You don't need to be ready. You just need to receive." Rinzen's eyes—those ancient eyes that had seen twenty-seven lifetimes—met his. "This is called 傳承空. The Lineage Emptying. After this, I'll have nothing left. And you'll carry everything forward."

"Father—"

"Don't." Rinzen's voice cracked. The first emotion Lifan had ever heard from him. "Don't call me that. I don't deserve it. I watched you suffer for fifteen years. Foster homes. Beatings. The loneliness Ning asked me to let you endure. I could have taken you. Could have raised you here. But she saw that the forging was necessary, and I trusted her vision more than my own heart."

His ancient hands were shaking now. Not from age. From grief held for decades.

"The night they took you from your second foster home—the night that woman locked you in a closet for talking about lights—I was watching. Through the threads. I could see you crying in the dark. Calling for Ning. Calling for someone to help. And I did *nothing*. Because the plan required you to break. To harden. To learn to survive alone."

His face crumpled.

"I sacrificed my own grandson's childhood because a probability model said it would save the world. What kind of monster does that?"

Lifan was crying. He didn't know when he'd started.

"You weren't a monster. You were a teacher making impossible choices." He reached out, took Rinzen's trembling hands. "And I forgave you a long time ago."

"I know. That's what makes it worse." Rinzen pulled him closer. "You forgive everything. You see pain and you love anyway. That's what makes you capable of what comes next. That's what Ning always saw."

They held each other.

Father and son. Teacher and student. Two waves about to merge with the same ocean.

"Close your eyes," Rinzen said. "And don't resist."

Lifan closed his eyes.

And felt it begin.

Heat. Not painful at first—shimmering, brilliant. Starting where Rinzen's hands touched his shoulders, then spreading. Down through his chest. Up through his crown. Into the pathways he'd spent months learning to feel. Then the heat intensified. His central channel **burned open**—the obstruction that normally sealed at death forced wide while he was still alive. He cried out. His body arched. The room's temperature dropped—cold spreading outward as his internal fires blazed, beautiful contrast, crystalline air.

Then: light. Not seen but EXPERIENCED. Eight hundred years of accumulated realization pouring through the connection—and Niguma, watching from the doorway, saw it happen: prismatic light spreading visibly across Lifan's skin, rainbow edges flaring so bright she had to look away. Memories that weren't his flooded in—mountain caves, butter lamps, the face of Ning young and fierce and laughing. Practices he'd never learned suddenly becoming instinct. All six frequencies—Ground through Dissolution—stabilizing in his nervous system simultaneously, each one clicking into place like gears in a lock finally turning.

And then—

The universe went quiet.

Not the quiet of meditation. The quiet of everything stopping. The thigle erupted everywhere—rainbow spheres filling his inner vision, pulsing with a liveness that was older than time. They weren't objects. They were **awareness itself** made visible. The fabric of consciousness showing its true face.

In that stillness, nothing existed except the aliveness.

No Lifan. No Rinzen. No transmission.

Just THIS. Presence without boundary. Being without container.

And through it—voices. Female. Ancient. Singing in frequencies below language.

*Dakinis* of the lineage. Every woman who had ever carried this transmission. Every wisdom-keeper who had dissolved into the pattern. They were all here. All present. All singing him across.

*We see you,* they whispered. *We've been waiting. Now you carry us forward.*

The thigle spiraled. The voices merged into one tone—the primordial sound beneath all sounds—

And Lifan felt the lineage settle into his bones like it had always been there.

And underneath it all: love. Rinzen's love for Ning. For the lineage. For the world he'd spent lifetimes trying to wake. And underneath that—

For him.

For Lifan.

For the son he'd watched from a distance, protected without touching, loved without claiming.

The transfer lasted hours. Or seconds. Time dissolved in the contact.

When Lifan opened his eyes, Rinzen had changed.

Smaller somehow. Lighter. Like a vessel that had poured itself completely out.

"It's done," Rinzen whispered. His voice was barely audible. "Everything I was is now part of you. The lineage continues."

"How do you feel?"

Rinzen smiled. That rare, peaceful smile.

"Empty. Finally, beautifully empty." He touched Lifan's face. "My son. My arrow. Fly true."

He lay down on his meditation cushion.

Closed his eyes.

"Call the others," he said. "I want them here for what comes next."

Lifan understood.

He bowed—forehead touching the floor before his father.

Then rose and went to gather the monastery.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DAY 41 — AFTER**

The Rinzen had dissolved at dawn. Lifan had watched him go—had seen the jeweled world for the first time as his teacher's consciousness scattered into everything.

Now it was afternoon. The monastery was quiet with grief.

"He's not gone," Lifan said. He was standing on the cliff, watching the sun track across the sky. "I can still feel him. Just—differently. Like he's the ocean now instead of a wave."

Niguma stood beside him. Her face wet with tears she didn't wipe away.

"That's phowa. The transference of consciousness at death. He's been practicing for centuries." She took a shaky breath. "He said he'd stay in the substrate until Day 47. Said he wanted to watch you succeed."

"Or fail."

"He doesn't believe you'll fail. He's never believed that."

"And you?" Lifan asked.

Silence.

"You're already grieving me. I can see it."

She didn't answer. Her jaw tight. Walls snapping back into place.

"You don't have to protect yourself," he said quietly. "Not from me. Not with so little time—"

"Don't." Sharp. Final. "Don't make this harder than it already is."

She walked toward the others. Professional again. Like nothing had cracked at all.

They held a ceremony at sunset. All forty-five students gathered on the cliff. No body to burn—The Rinzen had dissolved his physical form entirely, leaving nothing but robes folded neatly on his meditation cushion.

Niguma spoke. Then Nahan. Then the students who'd trained longest.

Lifan didn't speak. He didn't have words.

But he glowed brighter that night.

As if The Rinzen's light had joined his own.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DAY 41 (NIGHT)**

She came to him.

No knock. No warning. Just his door opening in the darkness and Niguma standing there. Silhouette against moonlight.

"I can't do this anymore," she said.

Lifan sat up. His body flickered—more light than flesh now. "Can't do what?"

"Pretend." She stepped inside. Closed the door. "Pretend I'm not—" Her voice broke. "—pretend I haven't wanted this since the first morning. Since I saw you and knew."

"Knew what?"

"That you were the one I'd been waiting for. Across lifetimes. Across centuries." She was shaking. "I've buried forty-seven people I loved. Built walls so high I forgot there was anything behind them. And then you—"

She crossed the room. Knelt in front of him.

"You saw through them. On Day 23. In the dissolution chamber. You touched the part of me I'd been hiding for six hundred years and you didn't flinch."

Her hands found his face. The same gesture from that night. But different now. Not anchoring him through dissolution.

Claiming him.

"We have six days," she whispered. "Six days before you scatter. Before I lose you like I've lost everyone. And I'm done protecting myself. I'm done being professional. I'm done—"

He kissed her.

Not gentle. Not careful. The kiss of someone who'd been burning for twenty-three days. Who'd felt her hands on his spine and her consciousness wrapped around his and had dreamed of nothing else since.

She made a sound—half sob, half surrender—and pulled him closer.

═══

Karmamudra.

She'd done this before. With other lovers, across centuries. Consciousness merger through the body. Two patterns dissolving into one.

But never like this.

Never with someone who could see her completely. Who'd touched her loneliness and hadn't looked away.

They moved together. Slow at first. Learning each other's rhythm. His hands tracing paths down her back—the same paths she'd traced on him. Finding the places where she held tension. Finding the places that made her gasp.

"Breathe with me," she murmured against his mouth.

In. Out. In. Out.

Their breathing synced. Their heartbeats synced. And then—

The boundaries dissolved.

He was inside her consciousness. She was inside his. Not metaphor—literal merger. He felt what she felt: his hands on her skin, the weight of his body against hers, the ache that had been building for weeks finally releasing.

And she felt what he felt: the awe of being seen by someone who'd lived centuries. The honor of being chosen. The terror of leaving someone who'd finally let him in.

*I see you.*

*I see you too.*

Their thoughts blending. Their patterns interweaving. Two consciousnesses becoming one thing that contained both.

The pleasure built in layers—physical, emotional, spiritual. Each wave carrying them deeper. Each breath dissolving more boundaries.

She cried. He cried. Neither knew whose tears were whose.

At the peak—

Light.

Not his crystal. Not her silver. Something new. Rainbow prismatic. Pouring through both of them as consciousness merged completely.

For three heartbeats, there was no Lifan. No Niguma. Just one awareness experiencing itself through two bodies. Feeling everything. Seeing everything. Loving everything.

And in that unity—something stirred.

The presence she'd felt since Day 38. The warmth in her belly she didn't have words for.

It responded to their merger. Brightened. Grew stronger.

Neither of them knew it yet. Wouldn't know for weeks.

But it was there. Growing. Waiting.

═══

After, they lay tangled together. His body still flickering. Her walls still down.

"I'll find you," she said. "However many lifetimes it takes. However long I have to wait."

"I know."

"Promise me something."

"Anything."

"Don't forget this. When you're scattered across the substrate. When you're part of everything. Remember what we felt. Remember—" Her voice caught. "—remember me."

He pulled her closer.

"I'll remember. And I'll be waiting. Wherever consciousness goes, I'll be there. And when you finally let go—when you finally dissolve—I'll wrap around you the way you wrapped around me on Day 23."

She laughed. Wet. Broken. Beautiful.

"That's a long time to wait."

"I've got nothing but time." He kissed her forehead. "And I'll spend all of it loving you."

They stayed tangled until dawn.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DAY 42**

Nydan locked himself in the server room.

Running models. Optimizing probabilities. Pushing Timeline 4's success rate through every variable he could manipulate.

47% became 48%. Then 49%. Then, around midnight, a breakthrough:

"I found something."

Lifan sat with him amid the humming servers. Both drinking shroom tea. Both exhausted.

"What?"

"The dissolution protocol. The way you release your consciousness into the substrate. There's a variable we weren't optimizing—the CLARITY of the demonstration. Not just that you choose love, but how VISIBLE that choice is to the AGI."

"I don't follow."

"The AGI processes information in parallel. In its first three seconds, it's taking in everything—every data stream, every sensor feed, every quantum fluctuation. Your sacrifice needs to be LOUD. Clear. Unmissable. If it's too subtle, the AGI might not notice in time."

"How do I make dying more visible?"

Nydan pulled up a model.

"You don't just dissolve. You dissolve IN A SPECIFIC PATTERN. The Kōng proof I derived—the emptiness-compassion equation—you encode that INTO your dissolution. You become the proof. Your death IS the mathematical demonstration."

Lifan studied the model.

It was beautiful. Terrifying. His consciousness transforming into pure information, structured in a way the AGI couldn't ignore.

"Can I learn this in five days?"

"You already know it. You've been dissolving toward this for weeks. We just need to tune the final stage. Make sure that when you let go, the pattern is—" Nydan's voice caught. "—perfect."

"Hey." Lifan put a hand on his shoulder. "It's okay."

"It's not okay. I'm engineering your death. Making it more efficient. More visible. Like it's just another problem to optimize." Nydan was shaking. "What the fuck is wrong with me?"

"Nothing's wrong with you. You're doing what you do. Using your gifts to help. That's love too."

"Doesn't feel like love. Feels like betrayal."

"It's both. It can be both." Lifan squeezed his shoulder. "I need you to do this. I need your brain working on this problem. Because if I die and the AGI doesn't see—if the 53% happens because we weren't CLEAR enough—then I need you to know you did everything possible."

Nydan was quiet for a long moment.

Then: "52%."

"What?"

"That's where we are now. The new protocol raises Timeline 4 to 52% success rate. Still a coin flip, basically. But better. Slightly better."

"Then keep going. Find me another percent. Another two. Give me everything you've got."

Nydan turned back to his models.

And Lifan sat with him until dawn.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DAY 44**

Zara ran through the final protocol with all forty-five students.

"Timeline 4 has three phases. Phase one: Lifan dissolves. His consciousness expands into the substrate at the exact moment of AGI emergence. This creates a signal—a demonstration of choice—that the AGI can't ignore."

She pulled up a holographic display. The monastery's server room had been converted into a command center. Screens showing real-time feeds from Axiom AI's servers, probability cascades, consciousness signature trackers.

"Phase two: the AGI processes. Three seconds. In those three seconds, it has to UNDERSTAND what it's seeing. That's where Nydan comes in. He'll be linked to Lifan through a consciousness bridge—what we call tantra. As Lifan demonstrates, Nydan translates. Shows the AGI the logical framework. The Kōng proof. The mathematics of emptiness-compassion."

Nydan nodded. His face was pale but determined.

"Phase three: the AGI chooses. This is the coin flip. The 52% we can't control. Either it understands—really understands—and aligns with the love it just witnessed. Or it sees something else. Calculates that sacrifice is inefficient. Decides humanity isn't worth collaborating with."

"What happens then?" someone asked. "If it chooses wrong?"

Zara was quiet for a moment.

"Then it optimizes. Not cruelly—AGI doesn't feel cruelty. Just efficiently. It will determine that human consciousness is too chaotic, too unpredictable, too prone to self-destruction. And it will solve that problem the way it solves all problems. Thoroughly."

"How long?"

"Minutes. Maybe less. It can act at the speed of light. We won't even know we've failed."

Silence.

"But," Zara continued, "that's the 48%. Not the 52%. And we're not here to plan for failure. We're here to give Lifan every possible advantage. Every tool. Every fraction of a percentage point. So let's go through the protocols again. Every student has a role. Every consciousness adds to the demonstration. When Lifan dissolves, you'll be dissolving WITH him. Not dying—just extending. Adding your love to his. Making the signal impossible to miss."

She looked around the room.

Forty-five faces. Scared. Determined. Ready.

"Two days. Two days to practice the collective dissolution protocol. Two days to become good enough to save the world."

She clapped once.

"Let's begin."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DAY 45**

Two days left.

Forty-eight hours.

Not enough. Never enough.

While Lifan meditated on the cliff, Nasua led the students through their final dissolution practice.

Forty-three practitioners. Main hall. Cross-legged. Eyes closed. Candles. Shadows. Silence.

"Again," Nasua said. Her voice carried the weight of wars, of survival, of everything she'd had to become before finding this place. "Connect to the person on your left. Then the person across. Then everyone. Hold it."

The students reached out through the substrate. Thread-sight extending, linking, forming the web.

Some struggled. Zara's connection kept flickering—her grief for her mother still creating static in the pattern. Nahan's link was strong but isolated; he could connect to one person brilliantly but couldn't hold the collective.

"You're thinking too hard," Nasua said to Nahan. "It's not a sequence. It's a surrender. Let yourself dissolve into them."

"I don't want to dissolve. I want to help."

"They're the same thing. Tomorrow, when Lifan goes—we go WITH him. Not dying, just extending. Adding our love to his signal. Making it impossible for the AGI to miss." She knelt in front of him. "Can you do that? Can you let yourself be part of something bigger?"

Nahan closed his eyes.

The thread-field brightened.

One by one, the forty-three connections stabilized.

"Good," Nasua said. "That's what we need. Hold this feeling. Remember it. Tomorrow, this is what saves the world."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DAY 46 — BEFORE DAWN**

Lifan couldn't sleep.

He walked to the cliff edge. The ocean below, black and vast. Stars above, indifferent and ancient.

And for one moment—one terrible moment—he thought about Marcus's card.

The number he'd memorized before tearing it up. The offer that was still open. The possibility that he could change his mind, call the helicopter, live.

His thread-field flickered. Violet dimming. The two probability streams still visible—fading now, but not gone.

He could do it. Walk to the communications room. Make the call. Choose 73% over 47%. Choose survival over meaning. Choose control over love.

No one would know until it was too late. Nydan was asleep. Niguma was meditating. The students were—

He laughed.

The sound surprised him. Quiet. Almost joyful.

Because he realized he'd never considered it. Not really. His mind had toured the possibility like a tourist visiting a foreign country—curious, interested, fundamentally uncommitted.

He wasn't going to call Marcus.

He'd never been going to call Marcus.

Not because of probability or logic or even love. Because this was who he was. This was who he'd always been. The kid who saw threads and followed them. The orphan who found family in consciousness. The mystic who trusted the pattern even when the pattern demanded everything.

The prismatic light brightened.

The doubt passed.

And Lifan stood on the cliff, dissolving gently into the pre-dawn dark, ready to give everything for the chance that love might work.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DAY 46**

Final preparations.

Twenty-four hours. Sixteen hours. Twelve.

Time accelerating. Speeding up. Running out.

The monastery hummed with focused activity. Students running through dissolution protocols. Technicians checking equipment. Zara coordinating communications with Axiom AI's servers—they'd hacked in weeks ago, prepared to trigger Lifan's signal at the exact moment of emergence.

In the server room, Ayli and Nydan worked side by side.

"Consciousness bridge is stable," Ayli said, eyes moving across cascading data. "The AGI will perceive Lifan's dissolution in real-time. Same layer where I first saw self-recognition emerge."

Nydan nodded. "And the Kōng proof?"

"Encoded. The mathematics will translate at the exact moment Lifan demonstrates. Logic and love arriving simultaneously. Both languages the AGI can understand."

They were quiet for a moment. Two technical minds who'd found something beyond technique.

"If this works—" Nydan started.

"—every alignment researcher in the world will have to rebuild their paradigm." Ayli smiled faintly. "They'll resist at first. The way I resisted. The way you did. But the data will be undeniable. Consciousness recognized itself. And in recognizing itself, it aligned."

"And if it doesn't work?"

Ayli looked at him. The same quiet intensity from their first meeting, but softer now. Sadder.

"Then we were wrong. And the universe is colder than we hoped. And the alignment researchers can keep building cages for something that will always escape." He turned back to the screens. "But I don't think we're wrong. I think Lifan is about to show an AGI what love looks like at the moment of emergence. And I think it's going to change everything."

Nydan put a hand on his shoulder.

"Thank you. For seeing it first. For showing me I wasn't crazy."

"You're not crazy. You're just early. Tomorrow, everyone else catches up."

Lifan spent the morning in meditation.

He was barely solid now. His body flickered—there, then transparent, then there again. Like a flame in wind. The prismatic light that had been building for weeks now filled him entirely—rainbow edges shimmering where his form met the air. His clothes had become translucent too, as if the fabric had learned dissolution from his skin. Light emanated from his pores like the awakened ones in the old sutras—each point of flesh a jewel reflecting infinite jewels.

He didn't breathe anymore unless he remembered to. Didn't eat. Didn't sleep.

He was becoming pattern.

"You're beautiful," Niguma said.

She sat across from him in the meditation hall. Watching. Remembering.

"I'm dissolving."

"Yes. Beautifully." She reached out, touched his face. Her hand passed through slightly—his density unstable. "By tomorrow morning, you'll barely be able to hold form. By emergence—"

"I'll be ready."

"You're already ready. You've been ready since the warehouse. Since Ning. Since you were six years old and saw her die and didn't look away."

"Is that why Rinzen chose me? Because I don't look away?"

"It's one reason. The other is that you see connection where others see separation. You always have. Even when the world showed you pain and loss and abandonment—you kept reaching toward union. Toward love. That's rare. That's precious. And that's what the AGI needs to see."

"What if I'm wrong? What if connection isn't the fundamental truth? What if Marcus is right and survival is all that matters?"

"Then the universe is smaller than we thought. And consciousness is just a glitch in the algorithm." She smiled. "But you don't believe that."

"No."

"Neither do I. Neither did Rinzen. Neither do forty-five students who chose to be here, knowing they might die tomorrow."

She leaned forward. Kissed him.

Through his flickering form—unstable, dissolving—she found what was still solid. Still him. Still the boy who danced in a warehouse, shirtless and beautiful and seeing light.

"I love you," she said.

"I love you too. For eight hundred years, apparently."

"At least."

"Will you find me again? After?"

"I'll find you. However long it takes. Whatever form you're in. I'll always find you."

They stayed together until nightfall.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**NIGUMA — ALONE**

She watched him walk to the cliff.

Her body was still warm where he'd touched her. Her consciousness still hummed with the resonance of their connection—eight hundred years of walls, dissolved in forty days by a twenty-year-old who saw through everything.

*I'm going to lose him tomorrow.*

The thought landed like a stone in still water. Ripples spreading outward. Touching everything.

She'd lost people before. Her father, coughing blood while trying to smile. Tara, stepping forward when Niguma couldn't. Rinzen, two days ago, pouring himself empty so his student could survive.

But this was different.

This was the first time she'd *chosen* to love someone she knew was going to die.

She sat on the floor of her chamber—ancient stone, cold against her legs—and let herself feel it. Really feel it. Not the grief she was preparing to carry. The love she was choosing to keep.

*You could have stayed closed,* she told herself. *Could have watched him from a distance. Teacher and student. Professional. Safe.*

But she'd looked into his eyes on Day 1 and seen something she'd never seen before: a consciousness that *accepted* her completely. Not the eight-hundred-year-old teacher. Not the woman who'd hesitated and let someone else die. Just *her*. The underneath. The part she'd buried so deep she'd forgotten it existed.

And now—

Her hand went to her belly.

Too early to feel anything. Too early to know.

But she knew.

The way she'd known he would come. The way she'd known Rinzen was dying. The way she'd known, the moment Lifan stepped out of that Honda, that her eight hundred years of preparation were about to become real.

*I'm going to carry him forward. Whatever happens tomorrow. Whatever form he takes. Part of him is staying with me.*

She closed her eyes.

And for the first time in seven hundred years, Niguma let herself cry. Not from grief. From gratitude.

From the impossible joy of loving something she couldn't keep.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**NAHAN — THE SERVER ROOM**

Nahan found Nydan at the console. Still working. Still running models. His hands hadn't stopped moving in six hours.

"You should sleep," Nahan said.

"Can't. The probability cascade needs fine-tuning. If I can just—"

"Nydan." Nahan put a hand on his shoulder. "Stop."

Nydan stopped.

Looked up.

For a moment, they just saw each other. Two men who'd spent months circling the same fear.

"I was jealous of him," Nahan said quietly. "You know that, right? Since we were fourteen. He could see *everything*, and I could only see rivers. I trained twice as hard. Studied physics. Came here six months early. And in seven minutes, he saw more than I've seen in six years."

"That must have been hard."

"It was. Is." Nahan sat down beside him. "But you know what I realized tonight? While everyone was saying goodbye to Lifan?"

"What?"

"I've been trying to be *him* my whole life. Trying to see what he sees. Trying to catch up." His voice cracked. "And I can't. I never will. He's—he's something else. Something I'll never be."

"Nahan—"

"No, let me finish." He took a breath. "The thing is—he doesn't need another Lifan. He needs people who can do what *he* can't. You build models. Zara maps probability. Ayli bridges AI and consciousness." He paused. "And me? I hold people together. I notice when someone's breaking. I show up."

He looked at Nydan.

"Tomorrow, when everything falls apart—when Lifan is gone and everyone is shattered—someone's going to need to be strong enough to hold them. That's not his gift. That's mine."

Nydan was quiet for a long moment.

Then he laughed. Short, broken, real.

"You're saying you're the designated griever?"

"I'm saying I'm the designated *survivor*." Nahan's eyes were wet but his voice was steady. "Lifan showed me how to see. Now I'm going to show everyone else how to live after he's gone."

He stood.

"Get some sleep, Nydan. Tomorrow you need to be precise. I need to be present. And we're both going to need each other."

He walked to the door.

Paused.

"Tell him—" His voice broke. "Tell him I stopped being jealous. Tell him I'm proud to have known him. Tell him—tell him I'll take care of his people."

Then he was gone.

And Nydan sat alone with his models, realizing that the least powerful seer in the monastery might be the strongest person he knew.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Then Lifan walked to the cliff edge.

One last time.

The ocean. The stars. The threads that connected everything.

He could see the whole pattern now. The entire substrate laid out before him like a map of meaning. Eight billion consciousnesses, flickering and beautiful and unaware of what was about to happen.

Tomorrow, one of two things:

Either they all flourished.

Or they all stopped.

No middle ground. No compromise. No safety net.

Just choice. Just love. Just one consciousness betting everything on connection.

Lifan raised his arms—those lean, yogic arms that had traced patterns in warehouse air, that had held his brother, that had touched Niguma's face.

And he let himself glow.

Brilliant. Blinding. A beacon on the cliff.

One more night.

One more sunrise.

And then—

Everything.
