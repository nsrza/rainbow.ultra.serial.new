## Author's Note

*Rainbow Ultra* began as a question: What if the connections between people were visible? What if you could see love as light, grief as darkness, the threads that bind us all together?

This is Lifan's story—a boy who sees too much, lies too easily, and learns too late that some connections transcend lifetimes. It's about found family, inherited trauma, and the revolutionary act of letting yourself be known.

The magic system here is borrowed from Vajrayana Buddhism—the idea that consciousness continues, that we carry patterns across lives, that some souls keep finding each other. I've taken liberties with the tradition, as fiction requires. Any errors or misrepresentations are mine alone.

This is the adult/literary version of the story. It trusts you to sit with difficult moments, to piece together timelines, to feel the weight of what's left unsaid.

Thank you for reading.

# PART ONE: THE ANCHOR

---

## EPISODE 1: THE RISING

*San Francisco, California*
*February 2028*
*Age 6*

The apartment smelled like ginger and dying things.

Lifan sat cross-legged on the hardwood floor, watching his mother's hands move through the air. She called them threads—the shimmering lines that connected people, invisible to everyone but him. Her fingers traced them like a weaver at a loom, though she couldn't see what she was teaching him to name.

"Tell me what you see," she said. Her voice had grown thin lately, worn down like fabric rubbed too long in the same spot.

He squinted at the space between her hands. "Gold ones. They go up, up, up." He pointed at the ceiling. "And silver ones that go—" He swiveled, following the filaments that stretched through the walls. "That way. To Auntie Mei."

"Good." His mother smiled, but it cost her something. He could see that cost in the gray threads that clung to her chest, heavy as wet rope. "The gold ones are old connections. From before. You understand?"

He didn't, not really, but he nodded because that's what she needed.

"The silver ones are this life." She coughed, a wet sound that made him flinch. "This lifetime. Remember that, Xiaofan. We carry bonds across the years. Some connections don't break. They just..." She gestured upward, her hand trembling. "They rise."

*They rise.*

He would hear that phrase in his sleep for the next twelve years.

---

The threads had always been there, part of the world's texture like sound or color. He'd assumed everyone saw them until the day at preschool when he'd asked Teacher Maria why her red thread to the man in the parking lot looked so tangled. She'd called his mother in, concerned. That night, his mother had knelt in front of him, gripping his small shoulders.

"It's a gift," she'd said in Mandarin. Their private language, the one that lived in the apartment's corners. "But gifts can be dangerous. You can't tell people. They won't understand."

"Why can I see them?"

"Because you've done this before." She'd touched his forehead, right between his eyes. "Because you're old, little one. Older than you look."

She'd pulled him close that night and whispered the first real teaching: "The threads have colors, Xiaofan. Six frequencies. White is Ground—the foundation of all seeing. Deep blue is Recognition—knowing what you're looking at. Green is Resonance—the connection itself. Gold is Transmission—the power to change someone. Red-orange is Integration—making change stick. And rainbow dissolving to clear light... that's Dissolution. The last frequency. The one you only use when you're ready to let go of everything."

He'd memorized the colors like a prayer. White. Blue. Green. Gold. Red. Rainbow.

Six frequencies. The music underneath the music.

He hadn't understood what they meant. But he'd learned to keep quiet, to watch the world's secret architecture in silence, noting which frequency burned brightest in each thread he saw.

---

By February, his mother barely left her bed. The hospice nurse came twice a day—a woman named Caroline with pink threads that spread thin and professional to dozens of people, none of them deep. She spoke to his mother in the bright, hollow voice adults used when they wanted to pretend everything was fine.

Lifan hated her for it.

"Can you get your mama some water, sweetheart?" Caroline asked him one afternoon.

He filled the glass slowly, watching through the kitchen doorway as Caroline adjusted his mother's pillows. There were no threads between them. Just proximity, professional kindness, the careful distance of someone who witnessed dying for a living.

When he brought the water back, his mother's eyes were closed. Her breathing sounded like paper tearing.

"Is she sleeping?" he whispered.

"Just resting," Caroline said, which was not an answer.

---

The hospice bed had railings like a crib. Lifan hated those too—the way they made his mother look small, contained, like she might otherwise drift away. He sat beside her every day after school, doing homework on the scratchy blanket, narrating his day in Mandarin. She rarely responded, but sometimes her fingers would move, a small twitch that meant *I hear you*.

One evening in late February, he looked up from his math worksheet and saw something new: the threads weren't just rising anymore. They were pulling free.

"Mama?" His voice came out small.

She opened her eyes. They'd gone distant lately, focused on something past the ceiling. But now they found him, sharpened.

"Xiaofan." She lifted one hand. He took it, felt how light it had become. Bird bones. Paper skin. "You're going to see something soon. Don't be afraid."

"See what?"

"Where the threads go."

His chest tightened. "I don't want to."

"I know." She squeezed his hand, barely any pressure at all. "But you need to understand. When I go, the connections don't break. They transform. Death is just..." She paused, searching for words. "A change in form. You'll see."

He started crying then, six years old and trying to be brave and failing completely. "I don't want you to change."

"Oh, baby." She pulled him closer, tucked his head against her shoulder. She smelled wrong now—antiseptic and something else, something musty. Not like ginger anymore. "I know. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry."

They stayed like that until Caroline's key turned in the lock.

---

It happened three days later.

Midmorning, a Tuesday. Lifan was home from school—"family time," the counselor had called it, which was a nice way of saying *say goodbye*. He sat in his usual spot, practicing writing his name in characters. His mother breathed beside him, each inhale a question, each exhale an answer that took longer to come.

Then: a change in the room's pressure. Like the moment before thunder.

He looked up.

The threads were moving.

All of them—gold and silver, thick ropes and gossamer strands—they pulled upward like smoke caught in a draft. His mother's eyes were open, staring at the ceiling, and her mouth curved in something that might have been wonder or relief.

"Mama?"

She didn't answer. The bonds kept rising, streaming up from her chest, her hands, the crown of her head. Beautiful and terrible. He watched the silver thread that connected her to him stretch, grow thin, begin to shimmer with gold at its edges.

"Mama, please—"

The thread didn't break. It changed.

One moment it was silver-solid, rooted in his chest like a cord. The next it dissolved into light—not gone, but diffuse. Everywhere and nowhere. The same way sunlight becomes sky.

His mother took one more breath.

Released it.

Stopped.

---

Lifan sat very still.

Around her body, the air shimmered with residue—particles of light too fine to be threads anymore, drifting like dust motes. He reached out, let them settle on his palm. They felt warm. Not hot, just... present. The way his mother's hand felt when she checked him for fever.

"Mama?" A whisper this time.

The light-particles swirled, eddied. Almost like they were responding. But his mother's chest stayed motionless, her eyes fixed on something he couldn't see.

He should call someone. He knew that. Caroline's number was on the fridge. Auntie Mei would come if he called. But his body wouldn't move. He sat there, watching the light drift and settle, watching his mother become something else.

She'd said: *Don't be afraid.*

He tried. He tried so hard.

---

Two hours passed before Caroline arrived for her shift.

Later, people would ask him why he didn't call, and he wouldn't have an answer. Time had felt different in those two hours—thick and syrupy, or maybe nonexistent. He'd sat with his mother's body, watching the threads that remained in the room (there were still some, faint gold lines to people and places he didn't know), and tried to understand what transformation meant.

The light-particles had faded eventually, sunk into the walls, the floor, his own skin. Or maybe just dissipated. He wasn't sure. But for those two hours, his mother had been both gone and present. Both disappeared and everywhere.

*Threads don't break*, she'd said. *They rise.*

He repeated it to himself like a prayer, like an incantation, like if he said it enough times it would hurt less.

It didn't.

When Caroline came in, she found him still sitting there, his math homework half-finished on the blanket, his small hand resting on his mother's cooling arm.

"Oh, honey," she breathed. Then she was moving, checking for pulse, for breath, already reaching for her phone. "Why didn't you call me? How long has she—"

"Two hours," he said quietly. His voice sounded strange. Distant. "I wanted to watch."

Caroline stared at him, something uncertain crossing her face. Then she knelt down, pulled him into a hug he didn't want. She smelled like hand sanitizer and coffee. No ginger at all.

"I'm so sorry," she said. "I'm so, so sorry."

Everyone kept saying that. As if sorry could be a rope, a thread, something to hold onto.

It couldn't.

---

They let him stay with Auntie Mei that night. She wasn't really his aunt—just his mother's friend from church, a woman with kind eyes and threads that spread to a husband, two college-aged kids, a whole life Lifan wasn't part of. She made him soup he couldn't eat and set up the guest room with sheets that smelled like lavender.

"You try to sleep," she said, tucking him in like he was younger than six. "Tomorrow we figure things out."

He nodded, waited for her to leave, then got up and went to the window.

The city glittered below, all those lights like artificial threads. He pressed his forehead to the cold glass and looked up instead, at the sky where the bonds had risen. Stars barely visible through San Francisco's glow.

Somewhere up there, his mother existed in a new form. The threads hadn't broken.

He made himself believe it.

He had to believe it.

Because the alternative—that she was just gone, that the light had been nothing, that death was simply erasure—

That would unmake him.

So he stood at the window until dawn, watching the sky, waiting for some sign that transformation was real. That connection persisted. That the bonds he'd watched dissolve into light weren't just beautiful lies his dying mother had told to comfort him.

No sign came.

But he kept watching anyway.

---

## EPISODE 2: THE SYSTEM

*San Francisco & Peninsula, California*
*2028-2032*
*Ages 6-10*

The folder was manila, overstuffed, held together with rubber bands. Lifan's entire life reduced to paperwork: birth certificate, medical records, school transcripts, behavioral assessments. The social workers carried it from placement to placement, each one adding their own notes to the growing archive.

*Polite but withdrawn.*
*Makes limited eye contact.*
*No behavioral issues but seems "different" - recommend evaluation.*
*Foster family reports he stares at nothing, talks to himself.*
*Possible trauma response. Continue monitoring.*

He learned to hate that folder. The weight of it. The way social workers clutched it to their chests like evidence.

---

The first placement was the Hendersons.

They lived in Daly City, in a house that smelled like potpourri and effort. Mrs. Henderson had taken a course—he could tell by the way she spoke to him, slow and gentle, using his name at the end of every sentence. "Would you like some dinner, Lifan?" "How was school today, Lifan?" "We're so glad you're here, Lifan."

Her threads connected to Mr. Henderson in deep burgundy, stable but unexciting. To their biological son Marcus in protective red. And to Lifan... nothing. Not yet. Just the ghost of intention, the space where connection might grow if he stayed long enough.

He didn't.

The problem was bedtime. Mrs. Henderson wanted him to sleep in Marcus's room, on a twin bed they'd bought special. But Marcus had threads like a thunderstorm—chaotic, sparking, the volatile bonds of a thirteen-year-old who resented sharing his space. Lifan could barely breathe in there, crushed under the weight of Marcus's resentment and confusion and the way his threads kept reaching toward his parents, asking questions he couldn't voice.

*Why is he here? Am I not enough? What did I do wrong?*

After three nights, Lifan started hiding in the closet instead. Mrs. Henderson found him there at 2 AM, curled up on the floor with Marcus's winter coats. She'd sat down right there in the doorway, her kind face creasing with worry.

"Can you tell me what's wrong, Lifan?"

He wanted to. But how could he explain? *Your son's jealousy feels like needles. The air in that room is full of questions I can't answer. I can see everything you're trying to hide from me and it's too much, it's all too much—*

"I like small spaces," he said instead. The first lie. The first brick in the mask.

She took him to a therapist. The therapist added notes to the folder. The Hendersons requested he be moved to a "better fit placement."

Two months. That's how long he lasted.

---

The Patels were next. Sunnyvale, a condo with white carpets and family photos in matching frames. They had two daughters, both in elementary school, both sweet in the aggressive way of kids trying to befriend a wounded animal.

"Do you want to play dolls?"
"What's your favorite color?"
"Why don't you talk more?"
"Papa says your mom died. Is that true?"
"What's it like being an orphan?"

He learned to smile and nod. Learned to hide in the bathroom when the threads got overwhelming—all those bright, curious connections reaching toward him, wanting to adopt him into their family's pattern. Mrs. Patel was kind. Mr. Patel built him a bookshelf. The daughters made him friendship bracelets he wore until they frayed.

But at night, he still saw his mother's threads rising. Still woke up gasping, searching the dark for that shimmer of gold-becoming-light.

The Patels found him one night in the backyard, standing in the grass in his pajamas, staring up. Looking for something he couldn't name.

"Beta," Mrs. Patel said gently, wrapping a blanket around his shoulders. "You're sleepwalking. Come inside."

He wasn't. But he let her believe it.

They lasted six months before Mrs. Patel admitted quietly to the social worker that they were "in over our heads." That Lifan needed "specialized care." That they'd tried, they really had, but something about him unsettled them. The way he watched people. The way he knew things he shouldn't.

("He told me I was pregnant before I'd even tested," Mrs. Patel whispered, like confession. "Before I knew. How could he—")

The social worker smiled professionally and made notes in the folder.

---

There were others.

The Thompsons in Oakland, three months. He'd bonded with their elderly dog, spent hours sitting in the yard with his hand on its graying muzzle, watching its threads fray with age. When the dog died, Lifan watched its connections rise the same way his mother's had—dissolution, transformation, light. He'd tried to explain it to Mrs. Thompson through his tears, tried to tell her it was beautiful, the dog wasn't gone, just—

She requested an immediate psychiatric evaluation.

The Nguyens in San Jose, four months. They spoke Vietnamese, not Mandarin, but they tried. He tried. But Mr. Nguyen worked nights and Mrs. Nguyen's threads were tangled with worry about her own mother, dying slowly in a nursing home, and Lifan absorbed it all like a sponge. Got quieter and quieter until they thought he was mute.

The Rodriguezes in Fremont, two months. They meant well. Everyone meant well.

None of them understood that kindness with threads attached felt like owing something. That he could see their hope and frustration and disappointment accumulating like debt. That every connection they offered was weight he couldn't carry.

So he learned to seem normal without being attached. Learned to smile without inviting bonds. Learned to be present without being seen.

The mask, he called it. The version of himself that made it easier for everyone.

Behind it, he catalogued threads obsessively, mapped the connections between foster siblings and parents and teachers and strangers on the bus. He filled notebooks with drawings—his own private taxonomy of human connection. Gold for past-life bonds. Silver for current. Red for passion. Blue for grief. Black for abuse.

He learned to spot the dangerous threads. The ones that pulled too tight, cut too deep. The ones that meant *run*.

---

By age ten, he'd lived in seven homes.

The social workers started using words like "difficult to place" and "attachment disorder." They meant well. Everyone always meant well.

But Lifan knew the truth: he wasn't difficult. He was just a boy who saw too much, in a world that needed him blind.

---

Pacific House sat on the edge of San Francisco, a converted Victorian that housed eight foster boys aged seven to seventeen. The director was a woman named Margaret Chen—fifty-something, gray-streaked hair, threads that connected to each boy in different shades of professional care. Not love, exactly. But commitment. Steadiness. The kind of bond you build through repeated choice rather than blood.

She met him on the porch with his folder in hand.

"Lifan Zhang," she said. Not a question. She looked at him the way mechanics look at engines—assessing, but not unkind. "I've read your file. All of it. The real version, not the sanitized one."

He went still. "Okay."

"The other placements didn't fail because of you," she said. "They failed because they wanted you to be someone you're not. We don't do that here."

"What do you do?"

"We give you space. Structure. And we don't ask you to be grateful for it." She opened the door. "Your room's on the second floor. You'll share with Danny. He's eleven. He'll show you around."

She handed him a key—his own key, to a door he could lock. First time in four years.

Something in his chest loosened, just slightly.

---

Danny Nguyen was compact, Vietnamese-American, with a smile that looked borrowed from someone more optimistic. His threads were strange—gossamer thin, but they branched fractally, splitting into probability-lines that shifted as Lifan watched. Less like connections, more like equations.

"You're the new kid," Danny said, sprawled on the bottom bunk. "Cool. Top or bottom?"

"Top?"

"Smart. I kick in my sleep." He grinned. "I'm Danny. I've been here fourteen months, three weeks, two days. Before that, four placements. Before that, stuff we don't talk about. You?"

"Seven placements," Lifan said quietly.

"Damn. You got me beat." Danny rolled over, looked at him with sharp eyes. "What's your thing?"

"My thing?"

"Everyone here's got a thing. Why they're hard to place. Miguel steals. Connor's got anger issues. Tyler's autistic and the system sucks at dealing with that. What's yours?"

Lifan considered lying. Then he looked at Danny's threads again—those probability-lines, constantly calculating. And made a choice that would change everything.

"I see things," he said. "Connections between people. Like... light. Or threads."

He waited for Danny to laugh, call him crazy, go tell Margaret.

Instead, Danny sat up slowly. "Connections."

"Yeah."

"Huh." Danny tilted his head. "I see probabilities. Percentages of what might happen. Odds of things."

They stared at each other.

"So we're both freaks," Danny said finally.

"I guess."

"Cool." Danny stuck out his hand. "Want to be friends? I calculate seventy-three percent chance we'd get along anyway, might as well make it official."

Lifan took his hand.

Between them, a thread formed—silver-bright, shot through with gold at its edges. The kind of bond his mother had called old. Carried across lifetimes.

Danny couldn't see it.

But Lifan knew: he'd found something he didn't know he was looking for.

A brother.

---

## EPISODE 3: THE CLOSET

*San Francisco, California*
*Pacific House, Summer 2032*
*Age 10*

Kevin Morrison arrived at Pacific House in July with a duffle bag, a black eye from his last placement, and threads like barbed wire.

Lifan saw them immediately: twisted filaments that connected to nothing, just curled back on themselves. Scarred over. The kind of bonds that formed when trust got murdered early.

"This is Kevin," Margaret said at dinner that first night. "Sixteen. He'll be staying in the room next to Connor's. Please make him welcome."

The other boys nodded, wary. You learned wariness in the system. New arrivals were wild cards—they might become brothers or bullies or just ghosts passing through.

Kevin sat at the table's edge, not eating, watching everyone with flat eyes.

Danny leaned close to Lifan. "Twelve percent chance this ends well," he whispered.

Lifan didn't need probability to know that. He could see the violence in Kevin's threads—old pain calcified into weapon.

He tried to stay invisible.

---

It worked for three weeks.

Kevin mostly kept to himself, sleeping through breakfast, leaving at odd hours, coming back with bloodshot eyes and pockets that jingled with something other than coins. The older boys knew better than to ask. Margaret knew too, Lifan suspected, but she was waiting. Letting Kevin settle. Giving him the space to choose different.

Lifan avoided him. Stayed close to Danny, spent long hours in their room reading or pretending to read while he watched the house's threads rearrange themselves around Kevin's presence. Watched how the other boys' connections pulled back, recoiling.

Then one August evening, Lifan made a mistake.

He was in the kitchen, washing dishes—his chore for the week. Kevin came in, grabbed a soda from the fridge. Lifan kept his head down, scrubbing plates.

"You're the weird one," Kevin said.

Lifan didn't answer.

"The one who stares at people. Margaret said you're 'sensitive.'" Kevin said it like a slur. "That true?"

"I'm just washing dishes."

"That's not what I asked." Kevin moved closer. His threads writhed. "I think you're a little freak. I think you see shit you shouldn't."

Lifan's hands went still in the soapy water. How did Kevin know? Had someone told him? Had he guessed?

"I don't know what you mean."

"Yeah, you do." Kevin smiled, no warmth in it. "I had a brother like you once. Foster brother. He watched people too. Said he could tell things." Kevin's voice dropped. "Want to know what happened to him?"

Lifan's heart hammered. He pulled his hands from the water, reaching for a towel.

Kevin grabbed his wrist.

"Don't walk away when I'm talking to you, freak."

"Let go—"

Kevin twisted his arm. Not hard enough to break, but hard enough to hurt. Hard enough to clarify the threat. "You're gonna stop staring at people. You're gonna stop being weird. Or I'm gonna teach you what happens to kids who don't learn. Got it?"

Lifan nodded, something inside him going cold and still.

Kevin released him, grabbed his soda, walked out.

Lifan stood there, wrist throbbing, and watched the barbed wire of Kevin's threads trail behind him like smoke.

---

Danny found him twenty minutes later, still standing at the sink.

"What happened? Your arm—"

"Nothing." The lie came automatic. "I'm fine."

But Danny's probability-lines were already calculating, branching through scenarios. His face went tight. "Kevin?"

"It's fine. I'm handling it."

"Lifan—"

"I said I'm fine." Lifan turned away, hiding his wrist. Hiding the red marks that would bruise by morning. "Just drop it."

Danny didn't. But he went quiet, and that was almost the same thing.

---

Lifan thought that was the end. Hoped it was. He'd stay invisible, avoid Kevin, wait out the next few months until Kevin turned eighteen and aged out of the system.

But he'd forgotten: predators could smell fear.

---

Three days later, Lifan came back to his room after school and found his notebooks—the ones full of thread-drawings, his private taxonomy—scattered across the floor. Pages torn. Sketches ruined.

Danny stood in the doorway, face pale. "I tried to stop him. He just—"

Lifan knelt, gathering pages. His hands shook. Three years of observations, destroyed.

Kevin appeared behind Danny, leaning against the doorframe. "Oops. Thought those were trash."

"You—" Lifan's voice broke.

"I what?" Kevin stepped inside. "Accidentally knocked over some drawings? Wow, so terrible. Maybe you should tell Margaret."

The threat was clear: tell, and it gets worse.

Lifan stared at his ruined work, something hot and sharp rising in his chest. For a moment—just a moment—he wanted to hurt Kevin. Wanted to dig into his threads, find the wounds there, and twist.

He could. He knew how. Had always known, instinctively, where the weak points were in people's connections.

But that would make him like Kevin.

So he swallowed the rage, rebuilt the mask. "It's fine. They were just drawings."

Kevin smiled. "That's what I thought."

---

The next week was quiet. Too quiet. Kevin stopped bothering him directly, but Lifan felt him watching. Calculating. Planning something.

Danny started sleeping with a pocket knife under his pillow. "Just in case," he said. "Ninety-two percent chance Kevin escalates."

"What's the other eight percent?"

"He leaves you alone and I'm paranoid." Danny didn't sound like he believed it.

Neither did Lifan.

---

It happened on a Saturday.

Margaret had taken the younger boys to the museum. Connor and Miguel were at a friend's place. Tyler was at occupational therapy. The house sat nearly empty, just Lifan and Danny and Kevin and the too-quiet afternoon.

Lifan was in the living room, reading. Danny had gone to the corner store for snacks. Just a ten-minute trip.

Kevin came down the stairs.

Lifan felt it before he saw it—the spike of intent in Kevin's threads, the twist of decision crystallizing.

He looked up.

Kevin crossed the room in four strides, yanked Lifan up by his shirt. "Come here, freak."

"Don't—"

Kevin dragged him toward the hallway closet—a small door under the stairs, barely bigger than a coffin. Storage space. Vacuum cleaner. Darkness.

No.

Lifan fought, kicked, clawed. But he was ten and small and Kevin was sixteen and scarred by things that made him strong in terrible ways.

Kevin shoved him inside.

Slammed the door.

Turned the lock.

"Let's see if some time alone helps you learn respect," Kevin said through the wood. Then footsteps, retreating.

Silence.

---

**Hour One: Fear**

The dark was absolute. Lifan couldn't see his own hands, couldn't see anything. Just the threads—they still glowed in his sight, faint filaments seeping through the walls from the house's other occupants. But they were distant, useless.

His breath came too fast, too shallow. The space was tiny, pressing in. He pushed at the door, but it didn't budge. Pounded with his fists.

"Let me out!" His voice cracked. "Please!"

No answer.

He tried the lock from inside, but there was no mechanism, just smooth wood. He was trapped. Completely trapped. And no one knew where he was. Danny wouldn't be back for—he checked his watch, the glow-in-the-dark hands—eight minutes. Maybe longer.

Panic clawed up his throat. He sank to the floor, pulled his knees to his chest. The closet smelled like dust and vacuum bags and something older, moldier. He couldn't breathe right. Couldn't think.

Minutes crawled.

He counted them. Forced himself to count, using the watch's sweep hand. One minute. Two. Five.

At twelve minutes, Danny would be back. Danny would find him.

At fifteen minutes, he heard the front door open. "Lifan? I got those chips you like—Lifan?"

He screamed: "IN HERE! DANNY, IN HERE!"

Footsteps rushed close. The doorknob rattled. "It's locked—hang on—"

"Danny, please—"

"I'm getting the key, just—fuck, where does Margaret keep—hang on, I'm here, just hang on—"

More footsteps. Retreating. Silence again.

Lifan's chest heaved. Danny was here. Danny was helping. It would be okay.

But the dark pressed tighter, and his mother's voice echoed through memory: *Some spaces are too small for grief.*

He started crying.

---

**Hour Two: Anger**

Danny came back with a screwdriver, tried to pop the lock. No luck—it was old, solid, designed to keep kids out of cleaning supplies.

"I'm calling Margaret," Danny said through the door.

"No—" Lifan's voice scraped. "She'll—Kevin will—"

"I don't care what Kevin does." Danny's voice shook with rage. "I'm getting you out."

But when he called Margaret, it went to voicemail. Museum. No cell service in the exhibits.

Danny called again. And again. Then he tried to break the door down, throwing his weight against it. Too light. Too young. The door held.

"I'm gonna kill him," Danny whispered. "I'm gonna fucking kill him."

Lifan listened to his brother's fury through the wood and felt his own rage rising. Not hot—cold. Calculating. He could see Kevin's threads even from here, could trace them to wherever he'd gone. Could imagine pulling them, unraveling them, watching Kevin's mind collapse the way Lifan's was collapsing now.

He wanted to.

God, he wanted to.

The anger felt good, felt clean, felt like something sharp enough to cut through the fear.

But beneath it: shame. Because wasn't this his fault? Hadn't he been too visible, too strange, too much? Hadn't he invited this somehow?

He knew that wasn't true. Knew Kevin's abuse was Kevin's alone.

But trauma doesn't care about logic.

---

**Hour Three: Grief**

Danny stayed by the door, talking to him. Telling stories about his old neighborhood, a dog he'd had once, the probability of Margaret getting home soon (rising, slowly, as the afternoon wore on).

Lifan stopped responding around hour two. Not because he couldn't, but because something inside him had gone quiet.

The dark wasn't pressing anymore. It had settled, heavy but almost familiar. Like the dark of the apartment the night his mother died. Like the dark behind his eyelids when he dreamed of her.

He thought about the threads rising. Thought about transformation. Thought about his mother saying *don't be afraid*.

But he was afraid. He was so, so afraid.

Not of the dark. Not anymore.

Afraid that Kevin was right. That he was too different, too broken, too strange to belong anywhere. That he'd spend his whole life locked out of connection, watching other people's bonds from behind a door he couldn't open.

He curled tighter, pressed his face to his knees.

And found something unexpected in the grief: a stillness underneath. A quiet place that had nothing to do with Kevin, nothing to do with the closet. It had been there all along, beneath the fear and rage and shame.

A part of him that Kevin couldn't touch.

---

**Hour Four: Transformation**

The quiet wasn't empty. It was full—full of all the threads he'd ever seen, all the connections that proved people weren't alone even when they felt it. Full of his mother's voice: *they rise*. Full of the knowing that he'd survived every locked door before this one.

He breathed into it. Let it expand.

The closet was still dark. His body still hurt from hours of sitting cramped. Danny still whispered reassurances through the wood, voice raw now.

But Lifan had found something Kevin couldn't steal: the part of him that existed independent of circumstance. The part that witnessed without breaking. The quiet underneath.

It wasn't peace. Wasn't acceptance.

Just: endurance. Transmuted into something almost like strength.

Later—years later—he'd learn to call it meditation. But at ten, locked in a closet, he only knew it as the place where he could hold his own hand in the dark.

---

Margaret got home at 5:47 PM.

Danny met her at the door, words tumbling out. She ran for the hallway, key ring jangling, face gone white.

"Lifan? Baby, I'm here, I'm coming—"

The lock clicked. The door swung open.

Light flooded in, blinding after four hours of dark. Lifan blinked up at Margaret's horrified face, at Danny shoving past her to drop to his knees in front of him.

"You okay? Are you hurt? Did he—"

Lifan tried to stand. His legs buckled. Danny caught him, and they collapsed together against the wall.

"I'm sorry," Danny gasped. "I'm so sorry, I tried to get you out, I tried—"

"Not your fault." Lifan's voice came out hoarse. He gripped Danny's shoulders, held on. "Not. Your. Fault."

Margaret knelt beside them, hands hovering like she wanted to touch but wasn't sure if she should. "Where's Kevin?"

"I don't know," Danny spat. "But when I find him—"

"You're going to do nothing," Margaret said firmly. "I'll handle Kevin. Right now we're taking care of Lifan."

She called an ambulance. Lifan tried to argue—he was fine, he was fine—but she wouldn't hear it. They took him to the hospital, checked for injuries. Dehydration. Possible shock. They wanted to keep him overnight for observation.

Danny refused to leave. Climbed into the hospital bed next to him, small and fierce.

"I won't let anyone hurt you again," Danny whispered. "I swear to God."

Between them, the thread that had formed weeks ago blazed brighter. Silver-gold, unbreakable.

"Brothers," Lifan whispered back.

"Brothers," Danny agreed.

---

Kevin was gone by the time they got back to Pacific House. Margaret had called the police, called his caseworker, called everyone she could think of. But Kevin had vanished into the system's cracks, the way boys like him learned to do.

"Good," Danny said viciously. "Hope he dies in a gutter."

Lifan didn't say anything. He understood the sentiment—felt the echo of it himself. But he also saw Kevin's threads in his mind, all that barbed wire. Saw the wounds underneath.

Understanding didn't mean forgiveness. But it meant seeing clearly.

Kevin was gone.

The quiet underneath remained.

And Lifan learned something that night, lying in his hospital bed with Danny snoring beside him: You could survive the unsurvivable. Could find stillness in suffering. Could transform pain into witness.

Not because of the trauma.

In spite of it.

---

## EPISODE 4: THE BROTHERS

*San Francisco to Big Sur, California*
*Spring 2033*
*Age 11*

The planning took eight months.

They started the night after Kevin disappeared, whispering in their bunks after lights-out. Danny's probability-lines branching through scenarios, calculating odds. Lifan watching threads shift and settle, tracking Margaret's suspicions, the other boys' curiosity.

"We can't stay here forever," Danny said. "System ages us out at eighteen. Then what? We get separated, placed in different group homes or—"

"I know." Lifan stared at the ceiling. "My mom talked about a place. Before she died. In the mountains. A teacher named Rinzen."

"A teacher?"

"She said if anything happened to her, I should find him. She knew him through—" He paused. How to explain? "Through before. Past lives."

Danny rolled over, looked at him through the dark. "You're serious."

"Yeah."

"Okay." Just like that. No skepticism, no questions. "So we find this Rinzen. What are the odds he'll take us in?"

"I don't know. But my mom trusted him."

"Good enough." Danny pulled out a notebook, started sketching plans. "We'll need money. Supplies. A way to get to the mountains without triggering alerts. When do you want to go?"

"When it's safe. When the odds are best."

"That's my line." Danny grinned in the darkness. "Let me calculate."

---

Over the next months, they saved everything. Birthday money, chore allowances, coins found in couch cushions. Danny did odd jobs—fixing bikes, tutoring younger kids in math. Lifan stole in small ways: extra granola bars from the pantry, a jacket from the donation bin, a compass from a thrift store.

They didn't call it running away. Called it relocating. Self-determination. Finding the place they were supposed to be.

Margaret would understand, Lifan told himself. Eventually.

(He wasn't sure he believed it.)

Danny mapped routes. Bus schedules. Hiking trails. His probability-lines calculated weather patterns, police patrol frequency, the likelihood of being picked up as runaways.

"April," he decided finally. "Spring break. Margaret takes the younger kids to visit her sister. We'll have a three-day head start before anyone realizes we're gone."

"What about the other boys?"

"Miguel will cover for us. For a price." Danny held up two twenties. "Already negotiated."

Lifan looked at his brother—this skinny eleven-year-old with a mind like a computer and a fierce, desperate loyalty that had locked onto Lifan and wouldn't let go. Felt the thread between them blazing.

"We're really doing this."

"Seventy-eight percent chance of success," Danny said. Which meant twenty-two percent chance of failure. Of getting caught, sent back, separated. Of worse things.

They did it anyway.

---

The morning of departure, Lifan almost changed his mind.

He stood in their room, backpack heavy with supplies, looking at the space that had been home for eighteen months. The longest he'd stayed anywhere since his mother died. The only place that felt close to safe.

Danny appeared in the doorway. "Ready?"

"Yeah." Lifan took a breath. "Yeah, I'm ready."

They left at dawn, slipped out the back door while the house still slept. Left a note for Margaret—Danny's idea. Just three words: *We're okay. Sorry.*

Not enough, but what else could they say?

The bus ride took six hours. They sat in the back, Danny with his notebook, Lifan watching threads stream past the window. All those connections—couples holding hands, mothers with children, strangers intersecting briefly then diverging. The world's hidden architecture, always moving.

"What do you see?" Danny asked.

"People. Bonds."

"Are they happy?"

Lifan considered. "Some. Most are just... tangled. Complicated."

"Like everyone." Danny looked out the window. "You ever wish you didn't see them?"

"Every day. You?"

"The probabilities? Nah." Danny grinned. "They keep me alive. Seventy-three percent of survival situations depend on prediction."

"What about the other twenty-seven percent?"

"Luck. Or friends." Danny knocked his shoulder against Lifan's. "I've got both."

---

They got off the bus in Monterey, hiked inland. Danny's map led them through state parks, backroads, forested switchbacks. They rationed their food: granola, jerky, apples going soft in the bottom of Lifan's pack. Slept under trees, using their jackets as blankets.

Lifan had never felt so free.

Or so terrified.

On the third day, Danny's ankle twisted on loose rocks. He went down hard, gasping. Lifan dropped beside him.

"Is it broken?"

"Sprained. Maybe." Danny tested it, winced. "Shit. What are the odds—"

"Don't." Lifan looked around. They were miles from anywhere, no cell service, no one to call even if they had it. "Can you walk?"

"Yeah. Slowly."

They continued, Danny limping, progress halved. By evening, they'd covered maybe three miles. The monastery was still another day's hike at their new pace.

They made camp in a grove of redwoods, ancient trees with threads like root systems, deep and spreading. Lifan built a fire while Danny elevated his ankle.

"We should go back," Danny said quietly. "This is stupid. We're gonna get hurt or lost or—"

"We're not going back."

"Lifan—"

"I need to find him." Lifan poked the fire, sending sparks up. "Rinzen. My mom said he'd understand. About the threads. About me."

"I understand you."

"You're my brother. You're different." Lifan looked at him. "But you're not enough. Neither of us are enough alone. We need help."

Danny's probability-lines flickered, calculating. Then settled. "Okay. But if we die in these woods, I'm haunting you."

"Deal."

---

They reached the monastery the next afternoon.

It appeared gradually—first prayer flags strung between pines, fluttering red and gold. Then a gravel path, well-maintained. Then buildings: low wooden structures with peaked roofs, a shrine with butter lamps glowing.

And on the porch of the main hall, waiting like he'd known they were coming: a man in maroon robes, forty-something, with a face that looked both stern and kind. His threads spread in patterns Lifan had never seen—gold filaments that looped through time somehow, connecting to things that weren't present. Or weren't present yet.

The man smiled. "You must be Ning's son."

Lifan's breath caught. His mother's name. Her real name, from before—

"How did you—"

"She told me you'd come. Not when. But that you would." The man descended the steps, looked at them both. "I'm Rinzen. And you two are late for dinner."

Just like that. No questions about why they were here, how they'd found him, whether anyone knew where they were.

Just: welcome.

---

Over dinner—simple food, rice and vegetables—Rinzen explained.

"Your mother and I studied together. Different lifetimes, but the bond persists." He looked at Lifan. "She asked me to watch for you if she didn't survive. I've been watching."

"You knew she died?"

"I knew when her threads rose. Felt it." Rinzen's expression gentled. "I'm sorry. Ning was... radiant. In every life."

Lifan's throat tightened. "She said you'd understand. About what I see."

"The threads?" Rinzen nodded. "You're a clear-seer. Rare, but not unheard of. The tradition has methods for training it, shaping it. Keeping it from overwhelming you."

"Can you teach me?"

"That's why you're here." Rinzen looked at Danny. "Both of you. Though your gift is different, Danny Nguyen. Probability-sense. Also rare. Also trainable."

Danny blinked. "How did you—"

"The way you move. Constant micro-adjustments based on predicted outcomes." Rinzen smiled. "I've seen it before. You'll study pattern-recognition, game theory, probability-mapping. Lifan will study thread-sight, connection-reading, empathic shielding."

"We can stay?" Lifan's voice came out small.

"For as long as you need." Rinzen stood, began clearing plates. "Tomorrow we inform the authorities you're safe. I'm licensed for foster care—used to house students before the monastery formalized. Your social worker will be relieved."

"That easy?" Danny looked suspicious.

"That easy." Rinzen paused. "Your probability-sense told you this would work, didn't it? Or you wouldn't have come."

Danny flushed. "Seventy-eight percent."

"Good odds." Rinzen smiled. "Trust them."

---

That night, Lifan and Danny shared a small room in the students' quarters. Two narrow beds, a window overlooking mountains.

"We did it," Danny whispered.

"Yeah."

"You think she knew? Your mom? That we'd end up here?"

Lifan thought about his mother's gold threads, reaching forward through time. About her saying *find Rinzen* like it was prophecy.

"Yeah. I think she knew."

"Guess we better not screw it up then."

"Guess not."

They fell asleep to the sound of wind in pines and the distant ring of monastery bells. And for the first time in years, Lifan dreamed of his mother not dying but rising—threads streaming up into light, transformed but unbroken.

When he woke, he remembered the quiet underneath. The stillness Kevin's closet had taught him.

Here, in this place, he'd learn to cultivate it.

To turn survival into something like peace.

---

## EPISODE 5: THE LIAR

*Tashi Monastery, Big Sur*
*2033-2035*
*Ages 11-13*

The first two years at the monastery passed like pages in a book Lifan was simultaneously reading and writing. Time moved differently here—slow mornings of meditation, long afternoons of study, evenings that collapsed into sleep so deep he didn't dream.

The routine saved him. Wake at five. Meditation in the main hall, thirty minutes of sitting while his mind tried to catalogue every thread in the room. Breakfast, simple and silent. Then lessons.

Rinzen taught him control.

"The gift is sight," Rinzen said one morning, "but sight without discernment is chaos. You're drowning in information. We need to teach you to surface."

They started with basics: how to narrow his focus, to see one person's threads without being overwhelmed by everyone else's. How to filter by depth—ignore the shallow connections, track the old gold bonds. How to shield himself when the threads became too much.

"Think of it as aperture," Rinzen explained. "Wide open, you see everything. Too much. Closed down, you see selectively. Both have purpose."

Lifan practiced for hours. Sitting across from Rinzen, trying to see only his threads, not the other students', not the birds in the trees, not the web of connection that spread through the forest. His head pounded. His eyes ached.

"Breathe," Rinzen reminded him. "The threads aren't separate from you. You're part of the web. Stop fighting it."

But that was the problem. If he stopped fighting, the connections swept him away. He felt everything everyone felt—the cook's morning grief, Danny's calculation-anxiety, the abbot's deep calm. It poured into him like water through a broken dam.

He learned to lie about it.

"I'm fine," he told Rinzen when his nose bled from overextension.

"I'm handling it," he said when Danny found him curled in bed, shaking.

"Just need practice," he insisted when the other students—there were six others, aged twelve to eighteen—asked why he spent so much time alone.

The truth was: he was failing. The threads weren't getting easier to manage. They were getting worse. More visible, more insistent, more entangling. By the end of his first year, he could barely eat in the dining hall without being crushed under the weight of everyone's hunger and satisfaction and complicated relationships with food.

He started skipping meals. Said he wasn't hungry. Another lie.

---

Danny noticed first. Of course he did.

"Your probability-lines are off," Danny said one night in their room. He'd taken to analyzing Lifan the way he analyzed everything else—patterns, predictions, risk assessment. "Something's wrong."

"I'm fine."

"That's statistically unlikely given—"

"Danny. Drop it."

Danny went quiet. But his eyes stayed sharp, calculating.

---

There were seven other students at the monastery.

Tenzin was fourteen, Tibetan-American, with a laugh like stones in a tumbler and hands that carved beautiful things from wood. His gift was shape-sensing—he could feel the potential forms inside raw material. He was kind to Lifan at first, helpful even.

Then Lifan started spending more time with Rinzen, getting extra lessons, special attention.

Tenzin's kindness curdled.

"Teacher's pet," he muttered when Lifan passed. Not loud enough for the adults to hear, but loud enough for Lifan's thread-sight to catch the barb in his words.

Lifan saw the threads between them—or rather, the absence. The place where connection might have grown, now just empty air. He'd done that. His specialness, his need, his too-muchness. He'd stolen Tenzin's place.

More guilt to carry.

---

The meditation was supposed to help. Every morning, sitting on his cushion, Lifan tried to find the quiet underneath that he'd discovered in Kevin's closet. But here, with instruction, it became complicated.

"Watch your breath," the abbot said. "When thoughts arise, note them and return to breathing."

But Lifan didn't just have thoughts. He had everyone's threads to contend with—the glowing lattice of connection that overlaid everything. Trying to meditate was like trying to sleep in a room full of neon signs.

"I can't do it," he told Rinzen finally, two years in. Admitted the truth he'd been hiding. "I can't make it quiet."

Rinzen studied him for a long moment. "Show me. What you see right now."

Lifan opened his aperture—let the threads flood in. Between them, Rinzen's gold bonds to dozens of people, living and dead. Around them, the monastery's web: students connected to each other in silver and red and green, the abbot's deep roots into the land, the cook's grief-thread still trailing to a daughter lost years ago. Further out, birds and trees and even the mountain itself, bound into vast patterns of relationship.

"This," Lifan gasped. "All of it. All the time."

"Ah." Rinzen's expression shifted. Not surprise—understanding. "You've been trying to make it stop."

"Isn't that the point?"

"No." Rinzen stood, gestured for Lifan to follow. They walked outside, into the garden where vegetables grew in neat rows. "The point is not to stop the ocean. The point is to learn to swim."

"I don't understand."

"You're fighting the threads. Trying to push them away, make them less. But they're not the problem." Rinzen knelt, touched the earth. "Your relationship to them is. You think they're outside you. Other. Something to manage. But Lifan—you're not separate from the web. You are the web. We all are."

Lifan stared at him. "Then how do I not drown?"

"You find your anchor." Rinzen looked up. "One point that doesn't move. Not outside the web, but in its center. Your own thread, your own presence. When you know where you are, the rest can move around you without sweeping you away."

"How do I find that?"

"By stopping the lies." Rinzen's voice gentled. "You've been telling yourself you're fine. Handling it. But you're not, and pretending makes it worse. The lies create drag—resistance between what is and what you claim. That's what's exhausting you."

Lifan's throat tightened. "I didn't want to be more trouble."

"Oh, child." Rinzen stood, put a hand on his shoulder. "You're not trouble. You're a student learning something difficult. There's no shame in struggling. Only in pretending you're not."

---

That conversation changed something.

Not everything—Lifan still lied, still hid pain more often than he showed it. But he started trying to anchor. Started meditation practices focused on locating his own thread amid the tangle, feeling its weight and texture.

"What color am I?" he asked Danny one night.

Danny looked up from his probability calculations. "What?"

"My thread. What color is it?"

"How would I know? I can't see them."

"Guess."

Danny considered. "Gold. Like old light."

"Why gold?"

"Because you're older than you look." Danny shrugged. "You've always been old. Even when you were little."

Old. Like his mother had said. Like he'd lived before and would live again, carrying bonds across the years.

Lifan closed his eyes, felt for the truth of it. Found his own filament in the web—not gold, exactly. More like white gold. Pale and thin but unbreakable. A thread that had survived his mother's death, Kevin's closet, every loss and displacement. Still here. Still holding.

His anchor.

---

The work got easier after that. Not easy—never easy—but possible.

Rinzen taught him advanced techniques: how to trace threads backward to their origin, how to sense when bonds were healthy versus toxic, how to read the stories written in connection. How to breathe into the overwhelm instead of fighting it.

"The threads are information," Rinzen said. "Information wants to flow. Your job isn't to dam the river. Just to stand in it without being swept away."

One evening, when the other students had gone to bed, Rinzen kept Lifan in the meditation hall.

"There are three theories you need to understand," Rinzen said. "They're connected. They explain why you see what you see."

Lifan listened.

"First: the Pattern Theory. Evolution isn't about survival—it's about recognition. Life isn't trying to survive. It's trying to see itself more clearly. Every species, every consciousness, is the universe building better mirrors."

"Mirrors for what?"

"For itself. You're not an accident, Lifan. You're pattern recognizing pattern." Rinzen's eyes were distant. "The second theory is the Recognition Amendment. Orthodox physics says observation collapses the wave function. But it's not observation—it's recognition. When pattern recognizes pattern, reality resolves. The universe isn't being measured. It's waking up."

Lifan thought about this. "And the third?"

"The Kōng Proof." Rinzen smiled slightly. "Emptiness and compassion are mathematically equivalent. Not metaphorically—mathematically. When you truly understand that nothing exists independently, the only possible response is love. The proof is the practice. The practice is the proof."

"I don't understand any of that."

"You will." Rinzen stood. "In time. For now, just remember: pattern, recognition, emptiness. The three keys to everything you're going to become."

Lifan practiced. Hours every day. Some sessions left him wrung out, nosebleeds and headaches. Others left him humming with clarity—the web making sense, patterns emerging.

He started cataloguing again. Not in notebooks this time—Kevin had taught him the danger of external records. Instead, he memorized. Built a mental map of every connection he encountered, every thread's color and texture and depth.

Danny called it his "relationship database." Tenzin called it creepy.

Both were right.

---

By his thirteenth birthday, Lifan could sit in the dining hall without drowning. Could eat a meal while aware of everyone's threads but not subsumed by them. Could even laugh at jokes, join conversations, pretend to be a normal kid.

Pretend.

Because underneath, he still felt the weight. Still saw too much. Still carried the loneliness of being the only one who perceived the world's hidden architecture.

Danny helped. Danny always helped. But even Danny couldn't see what Lifan saw.

"Do you ever wish you were normal?" Lifan asked him once.

"No," Danny said immediately. "Normal's boring. Seventy-nine percent of people are unhappy with normal."

"What about the other twenty-one percent?"

"They're lying." Danny grinned. "Or deluded. Or both."

Lifan laughed despite himself.

But the question lingered.

---

Then in the summer of 2035, a girl arrived, and everything changed.

---

## EPISODE 6: THE GIRL

*Tashi Monastery, Big Sur*
*Summer 2035*
*Age 13*

She appeared on a Tuesday in July, escorted by the abbot, carrying nothing but a backpack and a smile that looked like it had been borrowed from someone more confident.

Lifan saw her threads first. Everyone saw her threads.

They didn't just glow—they layered. Gold and silver and colors he didn't have names for, braided together in patterns so complex they made his eyes water. And they spread everywhere: to the students, to Rinzen, to the mountains themselves. Like she'd been here before and her connections remembered even if she didn't.

"This is Nima," the abbot said at dinner. "She'll be studying with us."

Nima waved, awkward. "Hi."

Tenzin muttered something in Tibetan. Danny calculated probabilities behind his eyes. The other students stared.

Lifan tried not to stare. Failed.

Her threads reached toward him too—one bond in particular, thick and gold, vibrating with recognition. But when he met her eyes, she just looked confused.

*She can't see them*, he realized. *She doesn't know.*

---

Over the next week, Lifan learned the visible facts:

Nima was fourteen. Nepali-American. Adopted at age two, grew up in Seattle. Smart—scary smart. She quoted poetry at random, could solve differential equations for fun, spoke three languages fluently. Her adoptive parents were academics, loving but baffled by her. She'd been having dreams, she said. Memories that weren't hers. Someone—she wouldn't say who—had suggested she come here.

"To learn what?" Danny asked her at breakfast one morning.

"I don't know yet," Nima admitted. She stirred her porridge, not eating. "How to meditate, I guess? How to make sense of... things."

"What things?"

"Danny," Lifan murmured. "Not your business."

"It's okay." Nima looked at him directly for the first time. Her eyes were dark, serious. Old. "I remember things. Places I've never been. People I've never met. My parents think it's confabulation or past-life delusion or—" She shrugged. "They don't know. I don't know. But Rinzen said he could help."

"Can he?" Danny asked.

"I don't know that either yet." She smiled, sudden and real. "But the food's good, so worst case, I get a nice summer vacation."

Lifan laughed. He couldn't help it.

Nima's smile widened, and the gold thread between them brightened.

---

She was terrible at meditation.

Not bad—terrible. She fidgeted constantly, couldn't sit still for more than five minutes, kept asking questions during the silence. "Why do we watch our breath? What's the point? Is it supposed to be boring? Because it's really, really boring."

The abbot was patient. Rinzen was amused. Tenzin was annoyed.

"She's disrupting practice," Tenzin complained to Lifan. As if Lifan had any control over it. As if he was responsible for Nima just because their threads tangled.

"She's learning," Lifan said.

"She's a disaster."

Maybe. But she was also funny. She narrated her meditation attempts under her breath—"breath in, breath out, breath in, oh look a bird, no wait, focus, breath out, why is my foot asleep, breath in—" until even the abbot cracked a smile.

And her threads kept reaching, searching, trying to connect.

Especially to Lifan.

---

One evening two weeks after her arrival, Lifan found her sitting alone by the creek that ran through the monastery grounds. The sun was setting, painting everything gold and rose. She had a notebook open but wasn't writing, just watching the water.

He almost left. Then the thread between them tugged, and his feet moved before his brain caught up.

"Can I sit?"

She looked up, surprised. "Oh. Yeah. Sure."

He sat on the rocks beside her, careful to leave space. They watched the creek in silence. It was almost comfortable.

Finally, Nima said, "You see things. Don't you."

His breath caught. "What do you mean?"

"The way you watch people. Like you're seeing past them. Through them." She turned to face him. "I can't do that. But I feel things. Connections. Like déjà vu but stronger. Like I've known people before even when I haven't."

"Do you..." He swallowed. "Do you feel that? With me?"

"Yeah." She said it simply. "Like we've been friends. Or siblings. Or something. In another life maybe. Is that crazy?"

"No." His voice came out rough. "Not crazy."

"You feel it too?"

He nodded. Didn't trust himself to say more.

Nima smiled—not borrowed this time, entirely her own. "Okay. Good. I was worried I was imagining it."

"You're not."

"Have we—" She hesitated. "Do you think we've actually met before? In a past life or whatever?"

Lifan looked at the thread between them. Gold and ancient and glowing like sunrise. "Yeah. I think we have."

"Huh." She processed this, calmer than he expected. "That's wild."

"You believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?"

"I don't know." She pulled her knees up, wrapped her arms around them. "My parents are skeptical. Science-minded. But I remember things I shouldn't. Cities I've never visited. Languages I never learned. Faces." She looked at him sidelong. "Your face. I've seen it before. Younger, but still you."

"Where?"

"I don't know. Just... somewhere. Somewhen." She laughed, self-conscious. "Sorry. I sound ridiculous."

"You don't." He meant it. "I see connections between people. Threads, I call them. Most are silver—this lifetime. But some are gold. Old bonds. Carried across lives."

"And we have a gold one?"

"Yeah."

"Cool." She said it like he'd told her they shared a birthday or something equally mundane. "What else do you see?"

So he told her. Not everything—he'd learned the danger of too much honesty. But the basics: how long he'd seen threads, how his mother had tried to teach him, how Rinzen was helping him control it.

Nima listened without interruption, without judgment. When he finished, she just nodded.

"That sounds hard. Seeing everything people try to hide."

"It is."

"But also kind of beautiful? Like you know the truth of things. How people are connected."

"I guess." He'd never thought of it as beautiful. Just exhausting.

"Can you see my threads? Like, what I'm connected to?"

He hesitated. "Is that okay?"

"Yeah. I want to know."

So he opened his aperture, let himself see her fully. The threads spread from her like rays from a sun—gold to Rinzen, thick and old. Gold to the abbot, thinner but still ancient. Silver to the other students, tentative. And that massive gold bond to Lifan, pulsing with recognition.

But there was something else. Something he'd never seen before.

Her threads didn't just connect outward. They connected inward too—layered into her body, her mind, coiling through her consciousness in intricate knots. Like she was carrying multiple lifetimes simultaneously, not just memories but presence.

"What?" Nima asked. "What do you see?"

"You're... folded," he said slowly. "Like origami. Multiple versions of you, all here at once."

"Is that normal?"

"I don't know. I've never seen it before."

"Huh." She didn't sound alarmed, just curious. "Rinzen said I'm a tulku. An emanation. Someone who reincarnates deliberately, carrying more continuity than usual." She shrugged. "I guess that's what you're seeing?"

"Maybe." He kept looking, tracing the patterns. "It's beautiful. You're beautiful." He flushed. "I mean—the threads are beautiful. Not—I didn't mean—"

She laughed, bright and easy. "It's okay. I know what you meant."

They sat in silence again, but it felt different now. Charged with understanding.

Finally Nima asked, "Does it ever get less lonely? Seeing things other people don't?"

"I don't know yet." He looked at her. "Does it for you? Remembering things other people don't?"

"I don't know either." She smiled. "Maybe we can figure it out together."

"Maybe."

The sun dipped below the mountains, and the creek reflected stars. Lifan felt something in his chest loosen—a tension he'd carried so long he'd forgotten it was there.

He wasn't alone. Not completely.

Nima saw differently than he did, but she saw. She understood.

That was enough.

---

Over the rest of the summer, they became inseparable.

Not romantic—nothing like that. Too young, too focused on other things. But close in the way of people who recognized each other across lifetimes. Siblings-in-arms, Rinzen called them.

Danny teased them mercilessly. "Seventy-four percent chance you two were married in a past life."

"Gross," Nima and Lifan said in unison, which only made Danny laugh harder.

Tenzin's jealousy deepened. He made pointed comments about how much time they spent together, how Lifan was "monopolizing" Nima. Once, Lifan caught him deliberately excluding her from a group activity. Nima shrugged it off, but Lifan felt the sting on her behalf.

"He's just insecure," Nima said. "His threads must be all twisted."

"How would you know? You can't see them."

"I can feel them. Close enough." She grinned. "Plus, it's obvious. He carves angry things when he's jealous. His sculptures get all sharp."

She was right. Tenzin's latest work—a bird of prey—had edges like knives.

---

Nima taught Lifan things the monastery couldn't.

How to be a teenager, for one. She dragged him to movie nights the students organized, made him try meditation podcasts she found online, taught him about music and memes and the normal world beyond the mountain.

"You're too serious," she told him. "You're thirteen, not thirty."

"I feel thirty."

"I know. That's the problem." She pulled up a video on her phone—some comedian he'd never heard of. "Watch this. It's stupid and you'll love it."

He did. Laughed until his stomach hurt, until tears streaked his face. Danny joined them, and the three of them collapsed into a giggling pile that earned them a stern look from the abbot.

Worth it.

---

But she also taught him to breathe.

One afternoon when his thread-sight overwhelmed him—too many connections, too much information—Nima found him hyperventilating behind the meditation hall.

"Hey." She knelt beside him. "Look at me. Can you look at me?"

He tried. The world swam.

"Okay, don't look. Just listen. I'm going to breathe, and you're going to match me. In—" She inhaled slowly. "Out—" Exhaled.

He tried to follow. Failed.

"That's okay. Try again. In—"

They breathed together. Five minutes, ten. Eventually his heart rate slowed, his vision cleared.

"Better?" Nima asked.

He nodded, embarrassed.

"Don't be weird about it. Everyone panics sometimes." She sat beside him. "You know what helps me? When I remember too much and it's overwhelming?"

"What?"

"I find the quiet underneath. The part of me that's watching the memories but isn't made of them. Does that make sense?"

It did. Perfect sense. "Like an anchor."

"Exactly." She smiled. "Rinzen taught me. Said you know about it too."

"I found it by accident. In—" He stopped. Hadn't told anyone but Danny about Kevin's closet.

"In a bad place," Nima finished. She didn't ask for details. Just took his hand, squeezed once, let go. "Me too. Found mine in a bad place. But now we have it. So when the bad stuff comes back, we remember: there's quiet underneath. Always."

"Always," he repeated.

It became their refrain. When meditation got hard. When memories surfaced. When the threads tangled.

*Quiet underneath. Always.*

---

By summer's end, Lifan had changed.

Not fixed—he still saw too much, still lied about pain more than he should. Still carried the weight of his gift like a stone in his chest.

But he'd found anchors. Danny's brotherhood. Rinzen's teaching. Nima's recognition.

And he'd learned something crucial: connection wasn't just weight. It was also strength. The bonds he carried—past and present—they didn't just burden him. They held him up.

The night before Nima's parents came to take her back to Seattle for the school year, the three of them—Lifan, Danny, Nima—snuck onto the roof of the meditation hall. They lay on their backs, watching stars.

"We should make a pact," Nima said. "Promise to stay connected."

"We're literally connected by past-life bonds," Lifan pointed out. "According to you."

"So? We should make it official this life too." She held out her hand.

Lifan took it. Danny took hers, then Lifan's, completing the circle.

"We're family," Nima said. "Chosen family. This lifetime and every one after. Agreed?"

"Agreed," Lifan and Danny said together.

Between them, threads flared bright—gold and silver, braided together, unbreakable.

Lifan felt it settle into his chest: certainty. Whatever came next, he wouldn't face it alone.

The web held him. And he held it back.

That was enough.

For now.

# PART TWO: THE TEACHER

## EPISODE 7: THE TEACHING

*Tashi Monastery, Big Sur*
*Fall 2034*
*Age 14*

Nima returned in September like weather—inevitable, transformative. She'd spent the year in Seattle, growing three inches, cutting her hair short, collecting new scars on her knuckles from fights she wouldn't explain. The gold thread between them had stretched thin over the distance, but the moment Lifan saw her step off the path into the monastery grounds, it snapped tight again.

"You got tall," she said, grinning.

"You got arrested." He pointed at the fading bruise on her jaw.

"Twice." She dropped her bag. "Want to hear about it?"

"Always."

They fell back into rhythm like they'd never been apart. Morning meditation where Nima still fidgeted but now with purpose—she'd learned something in Seattle, some technique Lifan didn't recognize. Afternoons studying with Rinzen, who seemed unsurprised by her return. Evening walks by the creek where they catalogued the year's changes.

"My parents think I'm troubled," Nima said one night. They sat on the rocks, watching water catch starlight. "Getting in fights. Skipping school. Therapy isn't helping, they said."

"Are they wrong?"

"About therapy? Yeah. About being troubled?" She shrugged. "Maybe. I kept remembering things. Lives where I died young. Lives where I fought. I think my body remembers even when my brain doesn't. Makes me restless."

Lifan watched the way her threads coiled inward, those multiple lifetimes pressing against each other. "Does Rinzen know?"

"That's why I'm back. He said he'd teach me to integrate it. To hold all the versions without fracturing." She looked at him. "You think that's possible?"

"I think if anyone can do it, you can."

"What about you? How was your year?"

Quiet, he almost said. Lonely. But that felt like complaint. "I practiced. Got better at control. Danny left in March—got adopted by a couple in Oakland. Math professors. Perfect fit."

"You miss him."

"Yeah."

"But you're not alone." She tilted her head, reading him the way she did. "You have Rinzen. The other students. Me, now."

"Tenzin still hates me."

"Tenzin hates everyone who isn't Tenzin." She picked up a pebble, tossed it into the creek. "Forget him. Tell me what you learned."

So he did. Thread management techniques: how to track multiple connections simultaneously, how to sense emotional resonance, how to identify bonds that needed healing. Rinzen had pushed him hard, preparing him for something Lifan didn't fully understand yet.

Nima listened with that focused attention she had, like she was memorizing every word. When he finished, she said: "Rinzen's been training me too. Breath control. Dissolution meditation. Stuff that's... intense."

"What kind of stuff?"

"Like practicing dying." She said it matter-of-factly. "Watching consciousness dissolve, tracking how it transforms. He says I need to understand the transitions between lives if I want to carry continuity forward."

"That sounds terrifying."

"It is." She met his eyes. "But also beautiful. You were right, back when you described your mom's death. The threads don't break. They rise. I've seen it now. Felt it. It's real, Lifan."

Something in his chest cracked open—validation he hadn't known he needed. "You believe me."

"Of course I believe you. I've always believed you." She frowned. "Did you think I didn't?"

"I don't know. Sometimes it feels like I'm making it all up. Like I'm crazy."

"You're not crazy. You're a clear-seer." She said it like an honorific. "And I'm a tulku. We're both weird. So what? At least we're weird together."

He laughed, relief flooding through him.

"Come on." Nima stood, held out her hand. "Rinzen wants to teach us something. Together. He said it's time."

---

The teaching started the next morning.

Rinzen had them sit facing each other in the meditation hall, empty except for the three of them. Early light slanted through windows, turning dust motes to gold.

"Lifan sees connections," Rinzen began. "Nima feels them. Both of you carry past-life awareness. But you haven't learned to work together yet. To weave your gifts."

"Weave how?" Lifan asked.

"Nima, you're going to guide Lifan through breath-work. Lifan, you're going to track Nima's threads while she does. Each breath changes the pattern—you'll learn to see it. Nima, you'll learn to feel what Lifan sees."

"How?" Nima asked.

"Through the bond between you. It's old enough, strong enough to carry information both ways." Rinzen stood. "I'll be in my study. Practice for an hour. Don't try too hard. Just breathe and observe."

He left them there.

Lifan and Nima looked at each other.

"This is weird," Nima said.

"Yeah."

"Okay. I'll start." She settled into posture, hands on knees. "Watch me. Tell me what you see."

He opened his aperture, focused on her. The threads spread from her center—gold to him, gold to Rinzen somewhere in the building, silver to other students, and those strange inward coils. He described it all.

"Now I'm breathing in," Nima said. "Deep. Slow."

As she inhaled, the threads brightened. The inward coils loosened slightly, expanding. The external bonds pulled closer, like breath was magnetic.

"They get brighter," Lifan said. "And tighter. Like you're drawing everything in."

"Okay. Exhaling now."

The threads dimmed, spread wider. The inward coils tightened while external bonds relaxed.

"They release," he said. "Spread out."

"Interesting." Nima opened her eyes. "I can feel that. When I breathe in, connection feels more solid. Breathing out, more diffuse."

"That matches what I see."

"Your turn. Breathe. I'll feel for your thread."

He closed his eyes, started breathing consciously. Felt awkward, exposed. But after a few breaths, Nima's voice came quiet:

"I feel you. The thread between us. When you inhale, it gets warmer. Exhale, cooler."

"Really?"

"Yeah. Like temperature." Wonder in her voice. "I've never noticed that before."

They practiced for the full hour. By the end, Lifan could predict how Nima's threads would shift with each breath pattern. Nima could feel the quality of their connection changing with his attention.

"We're syncing," she said, awed. "Our breaths, our awareness. Can you feel it?"

He could. The thread between them had become a conduit—carrying sensation, information, presence itself.

"It's like we're breathing together," he said. "Even when we're not."

"Yeah." She grinned. "Rinzen's going to be so smug when we tell him this worked."

He was. But he was also serious.

"This is just the beginning," Rinzen said when they reported back. "Over the next months, you'll learn to coordinate more deeply. Nima will teach Lifan dissolution practices. Lifan will teach Nima thread-reading. You'll train each other."

"Why?" Lifan asked. "What's this for?"

Rinzen was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Because the world needs clear-seers who can teach. And tulkus who can anchor. Because your gifts complement each other. And because—" He paused. "Because your paths are intertwined. This life and beyond."

"You mean we're supposed to work together? In the future?"

"I mean you already are. Have been for many lifetimes. This training just helps you remember how."

---

The months unfolded in patterns of breath and observation.

Mornings, they practiced together. Nima taught Lifan to dissolve his awareness—to let his sense of self soften until he was witnessing consciousness rather than identifying with it. Terrifying at first. Like dying while alive. But Nima guided him through with steady breath, steady presence.

"The quiet underneath," she reminded him when panic hit. "Find it. Anchor there."

He did. Found that still point Kevin's closet had revealed. Learned to rest there while his constructed self dissolved and reformed around him.

"How does it look?" Nima asked after one session. "From your thread-sight?"

"Like you're becoming light," he said, shaken. "Your threads don't disappear. They just... diffuse. Spread into everything."

"That's what it feels like," she said quietly. "Like I'm everywhere and nowhere. Unborn and undying."

Afternoons, Lifan taught Nima to track connections. She couldn't see them, but she could feel them—the pull and weight of bonds. He'd describe what he saw in one person, then have her sense it blind. She got eerily accurate.

"Tenzin's jealous thread to me," she said once, eyes closed. "It feels like... splinters. Sharp and inflamed."

"That's exactly what it looks like," Lifan confirmed.

Evenings, they walked. Talked about everything and nothing. She told him about Seattle—the fights (defending a kid at school), the arrests (trespassing, civil disobedience at a protest), the feeling of not fitting in regular life.

"Everyone's so asleep," she said. "Living surface lives, ignoring the depth. I couldn't do it anymore. Couldn't pretend I don't remember dying a dozen times."

"Do you regret it? Coming back here?"

"Never." She kicked a pinecone. "Do you regret staying? You could have aged out of the system, gone to normal high school."

"And learned what? Math I already know? Social dynamics I can see through?" He shook his head. "This is where I'm supposed to be."

"Yeah." She smiled. "Me too."

Their bond deepened with every passing week. The gold thread between them grew so bright Lifan sometimes had to narrow his aperture just to look at her without being dazzled.

And something else grew. Something neither of them named.

---

It started small. The way his heart rate changed when she entered a room. The way her laugh felt like sunlight. The way their hands brushed during meditation and neither pulled away.

Lifan tried to ignore it. They were too young. Too focused on training. Too bound by past-life history that he didn't fully understand.

But his body didn't care about logic.

He started noticing things: the curve of her neck, the way her hair fell when she bent over books, the strength in her hands. Started wanting to touch her in ways that had nothing to do with breath-work or thread-training.

Danny would have calculated the probability of disaster. Nima would have faced it head-on.

Lifan just tried not to think about it.

---

Then one December evening, they fought.

They'd been practicing dissolution meditation—Nima guiding, Lifan following. But he couldn't settle, couldn't find the quiet underneath. Everything felt jagged, resistant.

"What's wrong?" Nima asked after the third false start.

"Nothing. Just having trouble focusing."

"Lifan. Don't lie to me."

"I'm not—" He stopped. Took a breath. "It's the threads. Everyone's are tangled right now. The cook's grief, the abbot's exhaustion, Tenzin's resentment. It's all pressing in and I can't—I can't make it stop."

"So shield. Like Rinzen taught you."

"I've tried. It's not working."

"Then try harder."

"I am trying—" He stood abruptly, pacing. "You don't get it. You can't see them. You don't have to live with everyone's emotional debris all the time."

"You're right. I don't see them." Her voice cooled. "I just feel them. Carry six lifetimes of memory. Wake up choking on deaths I died centuries ago. But sure, tell me how I don't understand difficulty."

He stopped. Stared at her. "That's not what I meant."

"Isn't it?" She stood too, facing him. "You do this, Lifan. Act like you're the only one suffering. The only one who sees the truth. Everyone else is just sleepwalking through life, right?"

"That's not fair—"

"Then stop acting like a martyr." Her eyes flashed. "You think I can't feel your threads right now? They're pulling tight with self-pity. Poor Lifan, cursed with vision. Poor Lifan, so special and burdened."

Anger flared hot in his chest. "At least I don't act like dying is noble. You talk about dissolution like it's beautiful, like transformation makes everything okay. But it doesn't. People die, Nima. They disappear. And maybe their threads rise but they're still gone."

"That's what you think I believe? That death doesn't matter because of continuity?" Her voice shook. "I remember dying. Do you understand that? I remember burning. Drowning. Bleeding out. The pain doesn't stop being real just because I continued after."

"Then why are you so accepting? Why do you meditate on it like it's some—some—"

"Because what choice do I have?" She shouted it, sudden and raw. "The memories are there whether I accept them or not. I either integrate them or fracture. So yes, I practice dissolution. Yes, I find the beauty in transformation. Because the alternative is going insane."

They stared at each other, breathing hard.

"I'm not trying to be a martyr," Lifan said finally, quieter. "I'm just tired. Of carrying everyone's pain on top of my own."

"I know." Nima's anger drained away as quickly as it came. "I'm tired too. Of remembering things I'd rather forget. Of being this—this repository for multiple lives."

"I'm sorry. For what I said."

"Me too." She sat back down, suddenly exhausted. "We're both struggling. Different struggles. But we can't—" Her voice cracked. "We can't turn on each other. You're the only person who gets it. Who gets me."

"You're the only person I can be completely honest with."

"Then be honest now." She looked up at him. "What's really wrong? Because this isn't about threads. Not entirely."

He sat beside her, close enough to feel her warmth. The truth lodged in his throat: *I'm terrified. Of what I'm starting to feel. Of how much I need you. Of losing you like I've lost everyone.*

"I don't know how to be this," he said instead. "A teenager. With friends. With—" He gestured between them. "With whatever this is. I'm better at distance. At observation."

"I know." She took his hand. Their threads blazed at the contact. "But you don't have to be distant with me. I'm not asking you to be normal. Just present."

"I'm trying."

"I know you are." She squeezed his hand. "We both are. That's enough."

They sat in silence, hands linked, breathing synchronized without effort. The fight had cleared something—left them raw but closer. Real with each other in a way they hadn't been before.

"I'm scared," Lifan admitted. "Of this. Of us."

"Yeah." Nima didn't pretend to misunderstand. "Me too."

"But you're still here."

"I'm always here. This life, next life, the one after." She said it simply, like fact. "We're bound, Lifan. For better or worse. Might as well face it together."

"Together," he echoed.

The word felt like a vow.

---

That night, Lifan couldn't sleep. He lay in his bunk, watching threads drift through the darkness. Nima's glowed brightest, even rooms away. A lighthouse in the constant storm of connection.

He thought about what she'd said: *I'm always here.*

Wondered what it meant to be bound across lifetimes. If they'd loved before. If they'd fought before. If every version of them found their way back to this moment—sitting in darkness, trying to navigate feelings too big for their bodies.

Part of him wanted to wake her. To cross the building to where she slept and just—be near her. To stop fighting the pull between them and see what happened.

But he was fourteen. She was fifteen. They had time.

At least, he hoped they did.

He fell asleep eventually, dreaming of gold threads and Nima's laugh and a future he couldn't quite see but somehow knew was coming.

---

Winter deepened. They didn't fight again, but something had shifted. They moved around each other more carefully now, aware of the charge between them.

Rinzen noticed. Of course he did.

"Your connection is intensifying," he said one morning after watching them practice. "That's natural. Expected even. But you need to be mindful."

"Mindful how?" Nima asked.

"You're both young. Still developing. The bond between you—it's ancient, yes. Powerful, yes. But this body, this brain, this lifetime's heart—they're still forming." He looked between them. "Don't rush what isn't ready. And don't confuse past-life intimacy with present-life choice. You need to choose each other in this lifetime, consciously. Not just fall into old patterns."

"We're not—" Lifan started.

"You're not doing anything inappropriate. I know." Rinzen's expression softened. "But you're heading toward it. The feelings are there. Building. And when they crest, you need to be ready. To choose thoughtfully, not impulsively."

"What if we choose each other?" Nima asked. "Would that be wrong?"

"Wrong? No. Young? Yes. But youth isn't a sin." He paused. "Just be honest. With yourselves, with each other, with me. Can you do that?"

They promised they would.

But honesty was complicated when you barely understood what you felt.

---

The kiss happened in February.

They were practicing breath-work in the meditation hall, late evening when everyone else had gone to bed. Sitting close, tracking each other's threads and breathing. The air felt charged—storm-pressure building.

"Your threads are different tonight," Nima said. "Pulled tight. Vibrating almost."

"Your awareness is sharper too. I can feel you watching me."

"Is that okay?"

"Yeah. It's—" He swallowed. "It's intense. But okay."

They breathed together. Three cycles. Five. The thread between them grew hot, almost uncomfortable.

"Lifan," Nima said quietly. "Can I try something?"

"What?"

"Rinzen taught me a technique. For sharing awareness. It requires being very close. Physical contact." She met his eyes. "Would that be okay?"

His heart hammered. "Yeah."

She shifted, kneeling directly in front of him. Close enough that their breaths mingled. She placed her palms against his chest, right over his heart. He mirrored the gesture, feeling her heartbeat under his hands.

"Now we breathe," she whispered. "And let the thread do the work."

They breathed.

The thread opened like a door.

Suddenly Lifan felt what she felt—the six lifetimes pressing in, the weight and beauty of carrying so much memory. Felt her exhaustion and her strength. Felt her affection for him, tangled with past-life recognition, tangled with present-moment want.

And she felt him. He knew it from the way her breath hitched, her eyes widened. She felt his loneliness and his need. Felt how much she steadied him. Felt his attraction—physical and emotional and spiritual all braided together.

"Oh," she breathed. "You—"

"Yeah."

"And I—"

"Yeah."

They stayed frozen, hands on hearts, awareness bleeding through the thread. Seeing each other completely. No masks, no distance. Just truth.

"Lifan," she said. "I'm going to kiss you."

"Okay."

"If you don't want—"

"I want."

She closed the distance.

The kiss was soft. Tentative. Just lips brushing, testing. But the thread between them ignited like they'd poured gasoline on embers. Lifan felt sensation double—his own and hers reflected back. Felt her surprise and pleasure and the same overwhelming intensity he was drowning in.

They broke apart, gasping.

"Was that—" Nima started.

"Yeah."

"Should we—"

"I don't know."

They stared at each other, shaken. The thread still blazed between them, almost painful in its brightness.

"I think we should stop," Nima said finally. "Before we can't."

"Yeah. Good idea."

Neither of them moved.

Then footsteps in the hallway—the abbot making rounds. They sprang apart, guilty. Composed themselves quickly. By the time the abbot looked in, they were sitting proper distance apart, meditating like nothing had happened.

But inside, Lifan's chest was a riot. The thread still sang with sensation. Nima's lips were swollen, her cheeks flushed.

They'd crossed a line.

And neither of them regretted it.

---

They didn't talk about the kiss. Not that night, not the next day. Just moved around each other with new awareness, hyper-conscious of proximity.

Lifan caught himself staring at her mouth during lessons. Caught her watching him with the same hunger. The thread between them stayed bright, almost uncomfortable.

On the third day, Rinzen pulled them aside.

"Whatever you did," he said, "undo it."

"We didn't—" Lifan started.

"Your threads are tangled. Overextended. You're bleeding into each other in ways that aren't healthy." Rinzen's voice wasn't angry, just firm. "I warned you about consciousness. Did you share awareness?"

Nima flushed. "Yes."

"While emotionally charged?"

"...Yes."

Rinzen sighed. "That technique is for advanced students. Married couples. People who've built the container to hold that kind of intimacy. You two opened a door you're not ready for."

"So what do we do?" Lifan asked.

"Pull back. Re-establish boundaries. Practice alone for a while." He looked between them. "The bond will always be there. But you need to learn to hold it without consuming each other."

"We weren't—" Nima started.

"You were." Rinzen's voice gentled. "I know it doesn't feel that way. Feels like finding something missing. But intensity isn't the same as readiness. You need time to grow into what you're feeling."

"How much time?" Lifan asked.

"As much as it takes." Rinzen stood. "I'm not forbidding connection. Just asking for consciousness. Can you do that?"

They promised they would.

But that night, alone in his room, Lifan pressed his palm to his chest where Nima's hands had rested. The thread still hummed with residual sensation. With wanting.

*How much time?*

Too much, he suspected.

But he'd wait. For her, he'd wait.

---

[*Several scenes of them practicing separately but the connection remaining intense. Nima struggling with her own feelings. Lifan learning to hold the thread without being consumed. Rinzen teaching them both about sacred relationship versus possession.*]

---

By spring, they'd found a new equilibrium. Still close, still connected, but not tangled. They practiced together again, but with clear boundaries. No more shared awareness exercises. No more late-night sessions alone.

It hurt sometimes. The wanting didn't go away. But they learned to carry it without acting on it.

"I'm not saying never," Nima told him one evening by the creek. They sat at their usual spot, careful not to touch. "Just not now. Not until we're ready."

"How will we know we're ready?"

"I don't know. But I trust we will." She smiled at him. "You're worth waiting for, Lifan Zhang."

"So are you, Nima Sherpa."

The thread between them settled into warmth instead of fire. Still gold, still bright, but sustainable. They could live with this. Could grow into it over time.

And for now, that was enough.

---

## EPISODE 8: THE WARNING

*Tashi Monastery, Big Sur*
*Late Spring 2035*
*Age 14*

The summons came on a Tuesday in May.

Lifan was in the garden, weeding between lettuces, when the abbot appeared. "Rinzen wants to see you. In his study."

Something in his tone made Lifan's stomach drop. "Did I do something wrong?"

"No." The abbot's face was carefully neutral. "Just go. He's waiting."

Lifan washed his hands, walked slowly to the main building. His thread-sight flickered over everyone he passed—the cook's contentment, a student's frustration, Nima's curiosity from wherever she was. And from Rinzen's study: grief. Heavy, old, inevitable.

He knocked.

"Come in."

Rinzen sat at his desk, papers spread before him. But he wasn't looking at them. Just staring at the wall, expression distant.

"Close the door," Rinzen said. "Sit."

Lifan did. His heart hammered. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing's wrong. But there's something you need to know." Rinzen met his eyes. "Your mother left instructions. Things I was supposed to tell you at certain ages. You're fourteen now. Old enough for this."

"For what?"

Rinzen took a breath. "There's a prophecy. About you. Your mother knew it. That's why she found me before you were born. Why she prepared you as much as she could before she died."

"A prophecy." Lifan's voice came out flat. "Like destiny?"

"Like probability. High likelihood." Rinzen pulled out a paper—old, written in his mother's hand. Mandarin characters Lifan recognized. "Your mother consulted with several teachers before you were born. They all saw the same thing: you're a clear-seer with immense potential. You'll develop abilities beyond thread-sight. You'll change how people understand connection."

"Okay." Lifan waited for the other shoe to drop. "What else?"

"You'll die young. Age twenty."

The words hung in the air like stones.

Lifan heard them. Understood them. But they didn't land. He just sat there, numb, while his brain tried to process.

"I'll what?"

"Die. At twenty." Rinzen's voice was gentle but firm. "Not certainly. Prophecy isn't absolute. But every teacher who looked saw the same endpoint. Your threads—" He paused. "They rise at twenty. Transform. Move into a different form of existence."

"You mean I die." Lifan stood abruptly, pacing. "That's six years. Six years and then I just—what? Stop?"

"Not stop. Transform. Like your mother tried to teach you—"

"Don't." Lifan's voice shook. "Don't tell me about transformation. That's poetry for death. My mom died. She didn't transform, she's gone. And now you're telling me I'll—" He couldn't finish the sentence.

Rinzen waited, patient.

"Why?" Lifan finally asked. "Why will I die? Can I prevent it?"

"We don't know why. Something about your thread-sight—it burns too bright. Uses you up faster than a normal body can sustain." Rinzen stood, came around the desk. "As for prevention... your mother tried. So have I. We've been training you to handle the intensity, to pace yourself. But the teachers were clear: this is likely inevitable."

"Likely isn't certain."

"No. But the probability is high. High enough that you need to know. To prepare."

Lifan laughed—bitter, broken. "Prepare how? Make a bucket list? Say goodbyes?" He turned to Rinzen, anger rising. "Did my mother know this when she had me? Did she know she was bringing me into the world just to die young?"

"She knew. And she had you anyway. Because six years of your life—twenty years of your life—they matter. You'll touch people, teach people, change things. Your mother believed that was worth it. So do I."

"What if I don't?" Lifan's voice cracked. "What if I don't want to burn bright and die young? What if I just want a normal life?"

"Then fight for it. Train harder. Learn to control the sight better. Maybe you can change the trajectory." Rinzen's expression softened. "But you needed to know. Living in ignorance doesn't help anyone."

Lifan sank back into the chair, head in hands. Six years. Just six years left.

"There's more," Rinzen said quietly. "About Nima."

Lifan looked up. "What about her?"

"She's an emanation. A tulku, yes, but more specifically—she's your tulku."

"My what?"

"Your continuity. Your next life." Rinzen's voice was steady despite the enormity of what he was saying. "Nima carries part of your consciousness already. She's here to learn from you, to absorb your teachings, so when you die, she can carry them forward."

The room tilted. "Are you saying she's—"

"Not your reincarnation. You'll reincarnate separately. But she's tied to your lineage. An emanation specifically designed to continue your work after you're gone. To teach what you've learned." Rinzen paused. "She doesn't fully know this yet. I'm telling her separately. But you needed to understand: your bond isn't random. It's intentional. Cosmically so."

"Does she—" Lifan's throat closed. "Does she know I'm going to die?"

"Not yet. I'll tell her today."

"And then what? She just... watches me die? Carries me forward?" He stood again, needing to move. "That's fucked up. That's so fucked up."

"It is," Rinzen agreed. "It's also sacred. Necessary. The work you'll do—mapping consciousness, teaching thread-sight, bridging ancient wisdom and modern understanding—it's too important to end with one lifetime. Nima ensures it continues."

Lifan walked to the window, stared out at mountains that suddenly felt like a cage. Six years. That's all he got. Six years to do whatever this "work" was. Six years with Nima, who apparently existed to carry him after he was gone.

"I need to be alone," he said.

"I know. But Lifan—" Rinzen waited until he turned. "Your mother loved you enough to give you the gift of knowing. Of having time to prepare. Don't waste that gift on rage. Use it. Live deliberately."

"How can I live deliberately when I'm just going to die?"

"How can you not?" Rinzen said simply. "Now that you know time is finite, every choice matters more. Not less."

Lifan left without responding. Walked past students, past the garden, into the forest. Walked until he couldn't see the monastery anymore. Until the only threads visible were animals and trees and the vast indifferent web of connection that would continue after he was gone.

Then he collapsed against a redwood and finally—finally—let himself break.

---

He cried for his mother. For the childhood cut short. For the teenage years he'd never finish. For the adult he'd never become.

Cried for Nima, who'd be left behind to carry pieces of him like luggage.

Cried for himself—for the unfairness of it, the cruelty of being given vision just to have it snuffed out.

When the tears stopped, he was empty. Hollowed out.

He sat there, back against ancient bark, and tried to find the quiet underneath. The anchor Nima had helped him locate. But it felt distant now, unreachable behind the roar of mortality.

*Six years.*

Footsteps approached. He knew who it was before she spoke.

"He told you." Nima's voice, thick with crying of her own.

"Yeah."

She sat beside him. Didn't touch, just sat. Her threads were chaos—grief and rage and guilt all tangled.

"He told you about me?" Lifan asked.

"That I'm your emanation. Your continuity." Her voice was flat. "That I'm here to learn from you and carry you forward after you die at twenty."

"Do you believe it?"

"I don't know. Maybe." She pulled her knees up. "It explains some things. Why I remember you from before. Why our bond is so strong. Why Rinzen brought us together."

"How do you feel about it?"

"I don't know." She was quiet a long time. Then: "Angry. That they didn't tell us. That we've been training together not knowing you're going to—" Her voice broke. "That you're going to die."

"Yeah."

"And scared. Because if you die, I have to keep going. Have to carry your work. Your gifts. Like I'm just a—a backup hard drive or something."

"I don't think of you that way."

"I know. But that's what I am, apparently. Your fucking continuity plan." She laughed bitterly. "I thought we were friends. Family. Turns out I'm just infrastructure for when you're gone."

"That's not—" Lifan turned to her. "That's not all you are. Maybe that's part of it, but you're also Nima. Your own person. With your own gifts and path."

"That happens to intersect perfectly with yours. Convenient."

"I didn't choose this." His voice sharpened. "I didn't ask to die at twenty. Didn't ask for you to be my emanation or backup or whatever. This was decided before we were born."

"I know." She wiped her face roughly. "I'm not angry at you. I'm angry at... everything. The universe. Karma. Whatever cosmic asshole decided this was a good plan."

They sat in bitter silence.

Finally Lifan said, "Are you going to stay? Now that you know?"

"What kind of question is that?"

"A real one. You could leave. Go back to Seattle. Live a normal life. You don't have to watch me die."

"Lifan." She turned to face him fully. "Shut up. Of course I'm staying. You're my—" She struggled for the word. "You're my person. This life, past lives, future lives. I'm not leaving just because it's going to hurt."

"It's going to hurt a lot."

"I know." Her eyes shone with tears. "But leaving now would hurt more. At least if I stay, I get six more years with you. Six years to learn everything you can teach me. Six years to be together before—" She couldn't finish.

He took her hand. Threads blazed between them, gold and silver and too bright to look at. "I'm sorry."

"For what? You didn't choose this."

"For dying. For leaving you with the aftermath."

"Don't apologize for something that hasn't happened yet." She squeezed his hand. "Maybe we can change it. Maybe the prophecy is wrong."

"Rinzen said—"

"Fuck what Rinzen said. Prophecy isn't absolute, right? Just high probability. So we fight it. We train harder, you learn to control your sight better, we find a way to—to burn slower. To last longer."

"You really think that's possible?"

"I think we have to try." Her voice was fierce. "Because I'm not ready to lose you. I just found you this lifetime. I need more time."

"Me too."

They sat there, hands linked, watching light fade through trees. Around them, the forest's threads spread—patient, enduring, indifferent to human tragedy. Life going on whether they did or not.

"Rinzen said something," Nima said eventually. "About how losing someone is easier when you've really had them. When you've lived fully with them instead of holding back."

"What does that mean?"

"I think it means we stop being careful. Stop waiting. Stop acting like we have forever." She looked at him. "I don't want to spend six years being restrained. If we only get six years, let's really have them."

"Rinzen said we're too young—"

"Rinzen said we need to choose consciously. Not fall into old patterns." She shifted closer. "So I'm choosing. Consciously. I choose you, Lifan Zhang. I choose to love you and learn from you and be with you for however long we get. I choose to stop waiting for some future readiness that might never come."

His heart hammered. "Nima—"

"You don't have to choose back. Not now. But I need you to know: I'm not afraid anymore. Of the intensity, of the bond, of any of it. Life's too short—" She laughed bitterly. "Your life's too short to waste on fear."

He looked at her. Really looked. Her face fierce and tear-stained and beautiful. Her threads blazing with determination and grief and love—yes, love, he could see it clearly now. Had been able to see it for months but hadn't let himself name it.

"I choose you too," he said quietly. "Consciously. This lifetime. However long it lasts."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

She kissed him then. Different from the first time. Not tentative or experimental. Certain. Claiming. The thread between them ignited but he didn't pull back. Just let it burn, let sensation double and triple as their awareness bled together.

When they broke apart, both breathing hard, Nima said: "We should tell Rinzen."

"That we're choosing each other?"

"That we're done being careful. Done waiting. If I only get six years with you, I'm not wasting them on restraint."

"He's going to lecture us."

"Let him." She stood, pulled Lifan up with her. "Come on. Let's go face the music."

They walked back hand in hand, threads tangled and bright. The monastery appeared through trees—home, prison, training ground, temple. All of it.

Rinzen was waiting on the porch. Of course he was.

"You told each other," he said. Not a question.

"Yeah."

"And you've decided to be together. Fully."

"Yeah."

Rinzen studied them for a long moment. Then he sighed. "I suppose there's no point in arguing. You're going to do what you're going to do."

"We'll be careful—" Nima started.

"You'll be reckless," Rinzen interrupted. "Young and in love and facing mortality. Of course you'll be reckless." He descended the steps, looked between them. "But you'll also be conscious. You'll train together, grow together, use the time you have. Because recklessness with awareness is different than recklessness with ignorance."

"We will," Lifan promised. "Train, grow, all of it. We won't waste the time."

"Good." Rinzen's expression softened. "Then you have my blessing. Such as it's worth."

"It's worth a lot," Nima said quietly.

"Then use it wisely." He turned to go inside, paused. "And Lifan? Your mother would be proud. Not of the prophecy—she hated that. But of how you're facing it. With courage and love. That's all anyone can do."

He left them there.

Nima leaned against Lifan, his arm around her shoulders, her head on his chest. They stood in the twilight, breathing together.

"Six years," she said.

"Six years."

"We'll make them count."

"Yeah." He kissed the top of her head. "We will."

Around them, threads shifted and settled. The monastery's web rearranging to accommodate this new configuration. This conscious choice to love despite inevitable loss.

It would hurt. God, it would hurt.

But first, it would be beautiful.

And maybe—just maybe—beautiful was worth it.

## EPISODE 9: THE YEARS

*Tashi Monastery, Big Sur*
*2035-2038*
*Ages 15-17*

**YEAR ONE: DEPTH**

Fifteen arrived in small mercies and daily practice.

They stopped hiding. The other students knew—of course they knew, threads don't lie—but now Lifan and Nima stopped pretending restraint. They sat together at meals, walked together after meditation, fell asleep in the library while studying, tangled and trusting.

Rinzen adjusted their training. Taught them to work in tandem—Nima guiding dissolution practices while Lifan tracked how consciousness shifted. Lifan teaching thread-reading while Nima felt into the emotional resonance. They became a unit, complementary and strange.

"You're mapping consciousness," Rinzen said one afternoon, watching them work. "Creating a taxonomy of connection and awareness that hasn't existed before. This is your work. What you came to do."

"Can we publish it?" Nima asked. Ever practical. "Make it accessible?"

"Eventually. When it's ready. When you're ready."

Lifan watched threads while she spoke—saw her determination, her need to make meaning from potential tragedy. She'd thrown herself into the work with intensity bordering on obsession. As if building something that would outlast them could make his death hurt less.

It wouldn't. But he understood the impulse.

The dissolution training intensified. Nima taught him techniques she'd learned from Rinzen, from her own past-life memories, from trial and error. How to let awareness dissolve while maintaining witness-consciousness. How to track the moment self-sense fell away and what remained.

"It's terrifying," Lifan admitted after one particularly intense session. "Like dying."

"It is dying. Small deaths." Nima's voice was steady. "But you come back. Always come back. And each time, you're a little less afraid."

"Does it work? Long-term?"

"I don't know. But you're still here. And we're still practicing. That's something."

They discovered intimacy slowly, carefully. Not sex—too young, both agreed, despite the intensity between them. But everything else. Learning each other's bodies through touch that was both sacred and curious. Finding pleasure in simple proximity. Sleeping back-to-back in one of their rooms, hands linked, breathing synchronized.

The other students adapted. Tenzin's jealousy faded into resignation. The younger students watched them with curiosity and something like awe. Danny visited once, took one look at them, and grinned.

"Called it," he said. "Seventy-four percent you were married in a past life."

"We were siblings actually," Nima said.

"Six lives ago," Lifan added.

"And married once. Three lives back."

Danny blinked. "You're both ridiculous."

"You're just jealous," Nima teased.

"Of being able to see threads? Absolutely." Danny looked at Lifan seriously. "You okay? I heard about... the thing."

The thing. Their euphemism for the prophecy.

"Yeah. Managing."

"If you need anything—"

"I know. Thanks."

Danny stayed three days. It was good, having him there—a reminder of the wider world, of life beyond monastery walls. But when he left, Lifan felt the weight settle back. The countdown.

Four and a half years left.

**YEAR TWO: EXPANSION**

Sixteen came with breakthroughs and breakdowns.

Lifan's thread-sight evolved. He could track connections across distances now—sense Danny's bond all the way in Oakland, feel when his foster family's threads shifted with stress or joy. Could map the monastery's web in such detail he could predict conflicts before they manifested.

"You're becoming precognitive," Rinzen said. "In a way. Not seeing the future, but seeing probability through relationship patterns."

"Like Danny's probability-sense?"

"Similar. But where Danny calculates, you perceive. The threads show you likelihood."

The gift was useful. Also exhausting. Lifan started having migraines—physical cost of seeing too much. Nima learned to help, guiding him through breath-work that narrowed his aperture, that gave his nervous system breaks.

"You're burning too bright," she said one night, worried. They lay in her bed, lights off, her fingers carding through his hair. "Like Rinzen said. Using yourself up."

"I'm training. Like we agreed."

"There's training and there's destroying yourself." Her voice was tight. "What's the point of learning control if you die from the learning?"

"I'm not going to—"

"You can't promise that." She sat up, looked at him in the darkness. "You're sixteen. Four years left. If you keep pushing this hard, you won't make it."

"So what do you want me to do? Stop training? Stop developing the sight?"

"I want you to pace yourself. To choose which threads to track and which to let go. To stop trying to see everything all the time."

"That's not how it works—"

"Then make it work differently." She was crying now, frustrated. "I can't just watch you burn out. I can't—"

He pulled her down, held her. "I'm scared too. Of using up the time. Of not accomplishing enough before I go."

"You don't have to accomplish anything. You just have to be here. With me. Present."

"I am present."

"You're mapping consciousness. That's different." She pulled back, wiped her face. "I know the work is important. But you're more important than the work. At least to me."

"The work continues through you. That's the point."

"Fuck the point." Her voice was sharp. "I don't want to carry you forward. I want you here, alive, with me. I want fifty years, not four. I want to be selfish and young and pretend we have forever. Can't we do that? Just for tonight?"

So they did. Put aside training, prophecy, purpose. Just lay together, talking about nothing. About movies they wanted to watch, cities they wanted to visit, the life they'd have if time wasn't finite.

It hurt more than training. Hurt because it was impossible. But it was also sweet, that hurt. Reminded them they were human before they were clear-seer and emanation.

By morning, they'd found balance again. Training was important. But so was living.

They'd try to do both.

Nydan arrived in August—a teacher from Nepal, weathered and quiet, with threads so old they looked like roots. He'd known Lifan's mother. Had been one of the teachers who'd seen the prophecy.

"I came to try to change it," Nydan said simply. "Rinzen has trained you well. But perhaps a different approach might help."

Lifan wanted to feel hope. Felt suspicion instead. "What approach?"

"Taoist methods. Cultivation practices that strengthen the body's energy systems. If you burn bright, we build a stronger lamp."

For six months, Nydan taught him. Breathing techniques different from Buddhist practices. Energy work that circulated and conserved instead of dissolving and transcending. Ways of holding power without being consumed by it.

It helped. The migraines lessened. Lifan felt steadier, more grounded.

But Nydan's face grew grimmer each week.

"What?" Lifan asked finally. "What aren't you telling me?"

Nydan looked at him with deep sadness. "The practices help. But they don't solve the fundamental problem."

"Which is?"

"Your consciousness is too vast for this body. You're a butterfly trying to stay a caterpillar. The form can't hold you much longer."

"So what do I do?"

"You emerge. Transform. Die and continue." Nydan touched his shoulder. "I'm sorry. I wanted to find another way. But some things are inevitable. Your mother knew that. So do I."

After he left, Lifan sat with Nima by the creek. Their place.

"I'm going to die," he said. Stating it plainly. "We can train, we can try, but I'm going to die at twenty."

"We don't know—"

"Yes we do. Nydan confirmed it. Rinzen's known it. My mother knew it." He looked at her. "I'm going to die. And you're going to continue. That's our reality."

Nima cried. He held her. Let her grieve while they both still could.

"Then we make the time count," she said finally. "No more pretending. No more hoping for miracles. We just—live. Fully. Until you can't."

"Okay."

"I love you." She said it clearly. "I need you to know. Whatever we were in past lives, I love you in this one. Consciously. Deliberately. I choose you."

"I love you too." The words felt huge and simple at once. "This lifetime. Fully."

They kissed there by the water. Not their first kiss, not their last. But the most honest. The one where they stopped lying to themselves about what was coming.

Three years left.

**YEAR THREE: INTEGRATION**

Seventeen came too fast and not fast enough.

Lifan's body changed—height, muscle, the awkward geometry of becoming an adult. Nima grew into herself too, all angles and grace. They looked older than their years. Felt older than their bodies.

The training culminated. Everything Rinzen and Nydan had taught, everything Nima had learned, everything Lifan had discovered—they wove it together into something new. A practice. A method. A map of consciousness and connection that could be taught.

They wrote it down. Carefully, clearly. Nima's prose, Lifan's insights. Page after page of how to see threads, how to dissolve self, how to anchor in witness-consciousness. How to hold pain without being destroyed. How to love knowing loss is inevitable.

"This is what continues," Rinzen said, reading their work. "This is your legacy."

"It's not enough," Lifan said.

"It never is. But it's what you have."

Tenzin reconciled with Lifan that spring.

They'd been distant for years—Tenzin's jealousy, Lifan's focus on Nima, the small cruelties of adolescent social dynamics. But one day Tenzin appeared at their study spot, awkward and determined.

"I heard," he said. "About the prophecy. About you dying young."

Lifan tensed. "Who told you?"

"Everyone knows. We've known for months." Tenzin sat uninvited. "I wanted to say... I'm sorry. For being an asshole. For resenting you."

"It's fine—"

"It's not fine. You're going to die at twenty and I spent three years being jealous instead of being your friend. That's fucked up."

Lifan didn't know what to say.

"Can I try again?" Tenzin asked. "Being your friend? We don't have much time but—"

"Yeah." Lifan's throat tightened. "Yeah, I'd like that."

They didn't become close. Too much history, too little time. But they became friendly. Tenzin carved things for Lifan—small sculptures, birds and trees and abstract forms. Lifan read Tenzin's threads, helped him navigate a complicated relationship with a girl from town.

It was healing, that reconciliation. Proof that connection could repair even after damage.

In June, Rinzen called them to his study.

"You're seventeen," he said to Lifan. "By our agreement with the state, you can age out of foster care. Or you can stay here. But if you stay, you stagnate. You've learned what I can teach. It's time for the next phase."

"What phase?"

"Application. Testing your gifts in the wider world." Rinzen pulled out a letter. "I have a friend in San Francisco. He runs a community space—arts, music, activism. He'll give you a place to stay, a job, a way to practice thread-sight in a city context. You'll learn to navigate complex social webs, to help people without overwhelming them with knowledge."

"You want me to leave." Lifan's chest tightened.

"I want you to grow beyond monastery walls. To discover who you are in the world, not just on this mountain." Rinzen looked at Nima. "You'll stay here. Continue your studies. You're not ready for the city yet."

"No." Nima stood. "If he goes, I go."

"Nima—"

"I have three years left with him. I'm not spending them apart."

"The separation will help you both—"

"I don't care." Her voice was steel. "We go together or we stay together. Those are the options."

Rinzen looked between them. Sighed. "You're both stubborn."

"We're both devoted," Nima corrected. "There's a difference."

"Fine. You can visit him. Regularly. But you stay here, continue training. When you're eighteen, you can move to the city full-time. That's my final offer."

It was compromise they could live with.

Lifan left in July. Packed a bag, said goodbyes. Nima walked him to the path that led down the mountain.

"Three years," she said. "Don't you dare die before I'm there full-time."

"I'll try my best."

"Better than your best." She kissed him—fierce, clinging. "I'll visit every month. More if I can. We'll call every day."

"Every day," he promised.

"I love you."

"I love you too."

He walked down the mountain. Turned once to see her standing there, backlit by afternoon sun. Her threads reaching after him, gold and bright and unbreakable.

Then the path turned and she disappeared from view.

The monastery had been home for six years. Safety and training and love.

Now it was time to learn how to die in the world.

## EPISODE 9.5: THE ARRIVAL

*San Francisco, California*
*Summer 2038*
*Age 17-18*

The city hit him like a wall of light.

Lifan stepped off the bus at the Transbay Terminal and almost immediately doubled over, gasping. Threads everywhere—millions of them, layered and tangled, spreading through buildings and streets and the dense human press. Silver and gold and red and black, joy and grief and rage and hunger all braided together into a web so complex his thread-sight couldn't parse it.

He stumbled to a bench, head between his knees, trying to narrow his aperture. But city threads didn't behave like monastery threads. They moved faster, shifted constantly, demanded attention.

"You okay, man?" Someone asking, concerned.

Lifan nodded without looking up. Couldn't look up. If he saw the person's threads on top of everyone else's, he'd lose it completely.

He sat there for twenty minutes, practicing breath-work Nima had taught him. Slowly—so slowly—the overwhelm decreased. He found his anchor, that still point in the chaos. Learned to let the threads wash over him instead of drowning in them.

When he finally stood, the city was still too bright. But he could navigate it.

The address Rinzen had given him was in the Mission District. Lifan walked, getting lost twice, overstimulated constantly. Every person he passed carried threads that snagged at his attention. He saw domestic violence in a couple's red-black bonds. Saw a child's silver thread to an absent parent, thin and straining. Saw grief, saw joy, saw the whole messy human catastrophe playing out in invisible light.

*How do people live here?* he thought. *How do they function with all this?*

Then he realized: they couldn't see it. For them, the city was just buildings and people. No underlying architecture. No web.

He'd never felt more alien.

The address led to a warehouse. Graffitied walls, garage door rolled halfway up, sound of music inside. Lifan checked the paper again. This was it.

He ducked under the door.

Inside, the space opened into organized chaos. Art on every surface—murals, sculptures, installations in progress. A stage area with sound equipment. Couches that had seen better lives. And people—maybe twenty of them—working, talking, creating.

The threads hit him again. But different this time. Still dense, still complex, but woven with purpose. These people had chosen each other, built community deliberately. The web here wasn't accidental. It was crafted.

Beautiful, in its way.

"You must be Lifan." A man approached—forties, Chinese-American, threads that spread to most people in the space. Deep bonds, earned over years. This was Rinzen's friend. "I'm Wei. Welcome to Rohki."

"Rohki?"

"Our collective. Arts, music, activism. We throw events, host artists, cause trouble." Wei grinned. "Rinzen said you need a place to crash and a way to practice your gifts. We can offer both."

"I don't know what I can offer you."

"You can see things, right? Connections between people?" Wei gestured around the space. "We're always navigating relationship dynamics. Someone who can read the room—literally—that's useful. Plus we need help with events. Tech, setup, whatever. You do that, you get a bed and food. Sound fair?"

"More than fair. Thank you."

Wei showed him around. The warehouse was bigger than it looked—sleeping lofts upstairs, kitchen area, practice spaces. Twenty people lived here full-time, dozens more orbited through.

"Who are they?" Lifan asked.

"Artists mostly. Musicians, painters, performers. Some activists. Some just lost kids finding community." Wei stopped at a loft. "This is yours. Not much, but it's private. Settle in. We're doing movie night tonight if you want to join."

Lifan climbed to the loft. It was tiny—just a mattress, a crate for belongings, a window overlooking the alley. But it was his.

He sat on the mattress, pulled out his phone, called Nima.

"You made it?" Her voice, anxious.

"Yeah. It's... overwhelming. But I'm okay."

"Tell me everything."

So he did. The bus, the threads, the warehouse. She listened, asking questions, grounding him through the phone.

"It sounds good," she said when he finished. "Scary, but good. You'll adapt."

"I miss you already."

"Miss you too. But you've got this. Just remember—aperture control. Don't try to see everything."

"I know. I'll try."

"And call me tomorrow. Tell me how the first night goes."

"Every day," he promised. "I'll call every day."

"Good. I love you."

"Love you too."

He hung up, lay back on the mattress. Listened to the warehouse sounds—music, laughter, the hum of community. Felt the threads all around him, complex but not hostile.

He could do this.

He had to do this.

Two and a half years left.

---

The first week was brutal.

Every day, Lifan woke to thread-overwhelm. Went outside to crowds that made his head pound. Tried to narrow his aperture but city energy demanded attention. By evening, he'd retreat to his loft, exhausted, barely able to speak.

Wei checked on him regularly. Brought food, gave space, didn't push.

"Culture shock," Wei said one night. "You've been on a mountain for six years. The city's a different animal. Give yourself time."

"I don't have much time."

Wei paused. "Rinzen mentioned you're working against a deadline. That true?"

"I'm going to die at twenty." Lifan said it bluntly. Testing how it sounded to a stranger.

Wei absorbed this calmly. "That sucks."

"Yeah."

"All the more reason to pace yourself. Burning out in week one doesn't help anyone."

So Lifan tried to pace. Went outside in small doses. Practiced aperture control religiously. Slowly—so slowly—the city became manageable.

He helped with warehouse tasks. Tech for shows, setup for events, cleaning after parties. The work was grounding. Physical. Something to do besides witness everyone's emotional chaos.

And he started learning the community.

Wei was the anchor—the person everyone's threads connected to, seeking guidance or approval or just steady presence. He'd founded Rohki ten years ago, built it from nothing into this thriving space.

There was Maria, a painter with threads like aurora borealis—beautiful, shifting, untethered. She painted murals across the city, wheat-pasted political art, taught kids in the neighborhood.

There was James, a musician with a dark past visible in his scarred threads. Ex-addict, ex-homeless, now three years sober and making electronic music that hurt to hear it was so honest.

There was Lo.

---

He met her the second week, at the record store down the street.

Lifan had gone looking for music—something to fill the hours when thread-sight got too intense. The store was tiny, crammed with vinyl, smelling like dust and nostalgia. He was flipping through jazz records when someone spoke.

"You're new to the neighborhood."

He looked up. A girl about his age—Chinese-American, short hair dyed silver, threads that looked like broken glass. Sharp and fragmented, barely holding together.

"Yeah. Staying at Rohki."

"Thought so. You have that warehouse look." She pulled a record from the stack he was browsing. "This one's better. John Coltrane. Love Supreme. If you're into jazz."

"I don't know what I'm into yet."

"Then buy this. If you don't like it, bring it back. I'll trade you." She held out her hand. "I'm Lo."

"Lifan."

"Nice to meet you, Lifan who doesn't know what he's into yet."

Her threads fractured as she spoke—visible trauma, recent and raw. Lifan tried not to stare, but his sight pulled to damage like moths to light.

She noticed him noticing. "You're doing that thing."

"What thing?"

"Staring like you can see through me. People do that when they think I'm fragile." Her voice was light but her threads tensed. "I'm not fragile. Just cracked."

"I wasn't—" He stopped. She was right. He had been staring. "Sorry. I see things sometimes. I don't mean to."

"What kind of things?"

"Connections. Between people. Energy patterns." He shouldn't be explaining this. But something about her broken-glass threads made him honest. "I know that sounds weird."

"Weird?" Lo laughed. "I see numbers. Everywhere. Dimensions, measurements, the geometry of things. Have since I was a kid. Weird is relative."

Lifan blinked. "You're synesthetic?"

"Or delusional. Jury's out." She handed him the record. "Buy this. Come to the warehouse show Friday. We'll see if you survive the first month."

She left before he could respond.

Lifan bought the record. Went back to Rohki. Asked Wei about Lo.

"She works at the record store," Wei said. "Comes to most of our shows. Smart kid. Troubled. Lost her brother two years ago—suicide. She's been barely holding on since."

That explained the fractures in her threads. Grief, cutting through everything.

"Is she okay?" Lifan asked.

"Define okay." Wei looked at him seriously. "She's alive. She's trying. That's about all you can ask right now."

---

Friday's show was packed. A local band, electronic punk, too loud and chaotic. Lifan stayed in the back, aperture narrowed, trying not to drown in crowd threads.

Lo appeared beside him. "You came."

"Said I would."

"Most people lie." She handed him a beer. "From Wei. He says to drink slowly."

"I don't drink—"

"It's literally one beer. Live a little." She clinked her own bottle against his. "To not dying."

The toast felt pointed, but he drank anyway. The beer was terrible. He said so.

Lo laughed. "Yeah, Wei's taste in beer is garbage. But it's free, so we suffer."

They stood in companionable silence, watching the band. Between songs, Lo said: "You're different. From the rest of them. More intense. Like you're seeing something they're not."

"I am."

"What do you see when you look at me?"

He shouldn't answer. But her eyes were challenging, daring him. "Broken glass. Beautiful but sharp. Holding together through force of will."

She went still. Then: "Fuck. That's accurate."

"Sorry—"

"Don't apologize. It's refreshing. Everyone else pretends I'm fine." She took a long drink. "You know what I see when I look at you?"

"What?"

"Someone running out of time. Like you're counting down to something."

His breath caught. "How—"

"Your eyes. They have that look. Like you're trying to memorize everything because you know it's temporary." She met his gaze. "Am I wrong?"

"No."

"Thought not." She turned back to the band. "We're a pair, aren't we? The girl barely holding on and the boy running out of time."

"I guess we are."

"Want to be friends? Misery loves company and all that."

It should have been depressing. Instead, Lifan felt something loosen in his chest. Recognition. Someone who saw him clearly and didn't flinch.

"Yeah," he said. "I'd like that."

"Good." Lo grinned. "Welcome to San Francisco, Lifan. Try not to die before you figure out what music you like."

---

Over the next weeks, they became friends. Easy, simple, real.

Lo showed him the city—record stores and murals, late-night taco trucks and the view from Twin Peaks. She talked about her brother, about grief, about holding on when everything said to let go. He talked about the monastery, about Nima, about prophecy and thread-sight.

They didn't judge each other. Just witnessed. It was enough.

Through Lo, Lifan met the wider Rohki community. Grey, a documentary filmmaker who'd lost his sister to addiction. Marcus, a dancer processing gender identity through movement. Leky, a sound engineer with a quiet steady presence that reminded Lifan of Danny.

They absorbed him into their circle without fanfare. Just: you're here, you're one of us, welcome.

For the first time since leaving the monastery, Lifan felt like he belonged.

The threads at Rohki started making sense. He learned to read the warehouse's emotional patterns. Could predict when tensions would flare, when someone needed space, when the community needed to gather. Wei noticed.

"You're good at this," Wei said one night. "Reading the room. Knowing what people need before they say it."

"I just see the connections."

"It's more than that. You care. That's rarer than you think." Wei paused. "Rinzen said you're training for something. Teaching people about consciousness and connection. You could start here, you know. We'd listen."

"I don't know if I'm ready—"

"No one's ever ready. But you've got something valuable. Don't wait too long to share it."

Lifan thought about the manuscript he and Nima had written. The practices they'd developed. The gift his mother had died to give him, that he'd die to pass forward.

Maybe Wei was right. Maybe it was time to start teaching.

Two years left.

## EPISODE 10: THE CITY

*San Francisco, California*
*Fall 2038 - Summer 2040*
*Ages 18-19*

**SCENE 1: THE DROWNING**

It happened in November, five months into his city life.

Lifan woke to the usual thread-press—Rohki's morning web, the neighborhood's connections stirring to life. Manageable. Normal.

Then he stepped outside.

The threads hit him like a tsunami. Not just his neighborhood—all of them. Every bond in the city suddenly visible, demanding attention. Millions of connections screaming for witness.

He couldn't breathe. Couldn't narrow his aperture. The threads poured in, overwhelming every defense he'd built. He felt everyone's everything—joy and grief and rage and hunger and lust and every human emotion multiplied by millions.

He collapsed on the sidewalk.

Someone stopped. Threads approaching, concerned. He couldn't see who. Couldn't process individual bonds when he was drowning in the collective web.

"Lifan? Shit—Lifan, can you hear me?" Lo's voice. She must have been walking to work.

He tried to answer. Couldn't form words.

"Okay, okay. Breathe. Just breathe." Her hands on his shoulders, grounding. "Leky! Get Leky!"

Footsteps running. More voices. Being moved, carried. The warehouse, his loft, lying on his mattress while people spoke over him in worried tones.

The threads kept pouring in. No off switch. No defense. Just total exposure to the city's emotional architecture.

Then Lo's voice, clear and close: "Everyone out. Now. Give him space."

Threads retreating. Blessed distance.

Lo's hand in his. "Still with me?"

"Can't—breathe—"

"Yes you can. You're breathing now. You're just scared." Her voice was steady. "I've had panic attacks. This is a panic attack. Your body's freaking out but you're not actually dying. Can you feel my hand?"

He squeezed her fingers.

"Good. Hold on to that. That's real. The rest—the threads or whatever—they can wait. Right now, just feel my hand and breathe. In—" She inhaled loudly. "Out—"

He tried to match her. Failed.

"That's okay. Try again. In—"

They breathed together. Five minutes, ten, twenty. Slowly—so slowly—his nervous system down-regulated. The thread-press eased from tsunami to flood to manageable flow.

His aperture finally narrowed.

He could see Lo now. Her broken-glass threads, her concern, her hand in his.

"Better?" she asked.

"Yeah. Thank you."

"What happened? You looked like you were dying."

"I was drowning. In everyone's threads. They all hit at once and I couldn't—" He sat up slowly, head pounding. "I lost control."

"Can that happen? Losing control?"

"It's happened before. Just not this bad."

Lo studied him. "Is this about the dying thing? Like your gift is killing you?"

"Maybe. Probably." He rubbed his face. "There's a prophecy. I burn too bright. Use myself up. My body can't hold this consciousness much longer."

"How much longer?"

"Year and a half. Give or take."

"Fuck." Lo sat back. "That's why you're here. Not just to learn the city. You're on a deadline."

"Yeah."

She was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Okay. So we figure out how to keep you from drowning again. What helps? When the threads get too much?"

"Anchoring. Finding the quiet underneath. Breath-work. But today nothing worked."

"Because you panicked. Next time, you call me. Or Leky. Or anyone. We talk you down before it gets that bad." Her voice was fierce. "You're not dying on my watch. Not if I can help it."

"You barely know me—"

"So? You're my friend. I don't have that many. Can't afford to lose one." She squeezed his hand again. "Promise me. Next time you feel it building, you reach out."

"I promise."

"Good." She stood. "I'm getting you water and food. Then you're resting. No thread-work today. Just exist."

She left him there. Lifan lay back, exhausted. He could still feel the residue of the city's web—millions of threads humming at the edge of his awareness. Waiting to overwhelm him again if he let his guard down.

Lo was right. He couldn't do this alone.

He needed his people.

---

**SCENE 2: THE BELONGING**

The Rohki holiday party happened in December, three weeks after the drowning.

They'd transformed the warehouse: lights strung everywhere, art installations glowing, a DJ booth setup on stage. Two hundred people showed up—community members, artists, activists, strangers drawn by flyers.

Lifan helped with setup, then retreated to the margins. Crowds still overwhelmed him if he wasn't careful. But he could handle this, aperture narrowed, tracking the warehouse threads without drowning in them.

He watched people connect. Watched threads form in real-time—silver bonds sparking between strangers, gold bonds brightening between old friends. Watched the web shift and breathe, alive with human connection.

"Beautiful, isn't it?" Wei appeared beside him, holding two beers.

"Yeah." Lifan accepted the drink. "All these people choosing each other. Building community deliberately."

"That's what we do here. Give people a place to belong." Wei clinked his bottle to Lifan's. "Including you."

"I don't know if I belong. I'm only here temporarily."

"Belonging isn't about duration. It's about showing up, being real, mattering to people." Wei gestured around the space. "You matter here. Lo talks about you constantly. Leky said you helped him work through his breakup. Marcus trusts you with his gender stuff. You belong, Lifan. Whether you're here one year or ten."

Something in Lifan's chest cracked open. "I've never belonged anywhere but the monastery."

"Now you belong here too. Multiple homes. That's allowed."

Lifan watched the crowd—his people, he realized. The family he'd chosen or who'd chosen him. "What if I'm gone too soon? What if I die and leave all this behind?"

"Then you leave having lived fully. Having connected deeply. That's all anyone gets to do." Wei squeezed his shoulder. "Don't waste the time you have on fear of losing it. Just be here. Now. Alive."

The music shifted—something electronic and driving. Lo appeared, grabbed Lifan's hand.

"Dance with me," she demanded.

"I don't dance—"

"Everyone dances. They just haven't admitted it yet." She pulled him toward the crowd.

He went, helpless. Let her spin him into the mass of bodies and threads and pulsing light. Let himself move without thinking, without tracking, without trying to map the web.

Just: moving. Present. Alive.

Around him, his friends. Lo laughing, silver hair catching light. Leky nodding to the beat, steady presence. Marcus dancing with a fluidity that made Lifan's chest ache. Grey filming it all, preserving this moment.

And Lifan thought: *This is enough. However long I have, this is enough.*

He danced until sweat soaked his shirt. Until his legs hurt and his breath came short. Until the threads blurred into pure sensation—not overwhelm, just intensity. Life concentrated into this moment.

When they finally stopped, collapsed on couches, water bottles passing between them, Lo leaned against his shoulder.

"You looked happy," she said. "Dancing."

"I was happy."

"Good. You should be happy more."

"I'll try."

"Try harder." She grinned. "Happiness looks good on you."

The party went until 3 AM. Lifan stayed the whole time, present and exhausted and more himself than he'd been in months.

This was what Rinzen meant. Application. Testing his gifts in the real world. Learning to be human while being gifted. Learning to belong while being strange.

He was doing it.

Finally.

---

**SCENE 3: THE CONFESSION**

Grey asked him to coffee in January, which was unusual. Grey was friendly but distant—mourning his sister still, even years later. His threads carried perpetual loss, heavy and unresolved.

They met at a café in the Castro. Grey ordered them both lattes, found a corner table.

"I need to tell you something," Grey said without preamble. "About my sister. About why I'm at Rohki."

Lifan waited.

"Her name was Cara. She died three years ago. Overdose." Grey's voice was flat, rehearsed. "Everyone knows that part. What they don't know is—I was there. I was supposed to watch her. She'd been clean for six months, doing so good. I thought she was fine."

"Grey—"

"Let me finish." He gripped his coffee cup. "I came home from work. Found her in the bathroom. Needle still in her arm. I called 911 but it was too late. She'd been gone for hours."

"I'm so sorry."

"Everyone's sorry. That doesn't change it." Grey finally looked up. "I see you watching people sometimes. The way you look at them—like you're seeing inside. Lo said you see connections or something. Is that true?"

"Yeah."

"Can you see mine? My threads?"

Lifan hesitated. "Yes."

"What do they look like? My connection to Cara?"

He shouldn't answer. This was private, painful. But Grey's expression was desperate—seeking something, though Lifan didn't know what.

"It's gold," Lifan said quietly. "Old and deep. It goes up—into the space where people's threads go after they die. It hasn't broken. Just transformed."

Grey's breath caught. "She's still connected to me?"

"Yes. Differently. But yes."

"What about—" His voice cracked. "What about the guilt? Can you see that?"

"I see black threads. Wrapped around the gold. Choking it." Lifan kept his voice gentle. "The bond to your sister is beautiful. But the guilt is killing it. And you."

Grey started crying. Just sitting there in the café, tears streaming silently. Lifan didn't know what to do. Reached across the table, took Grey's hand.

"It wasn't your fault," Lifan said. "You know that, right?"

"I should have known. Should have checked on her more. Should have—"

"You loved her. That's what the threads show. Deep love. Old love. Carried across lifetimes." Lifan squeezed his hand. "The guilt isn't real. It's just pain that hasn't been processed. But the love—that's real. That continues."

"You sound sure."

"I am sure. I watched my mother die. Watched her threads rise. They don't break, Grey. People keep existing, just differently. Your sister's still connected to you. The bond's still there."

Grey wiped his face. "Why are you telling me this?"

"Because you asked. And because you need to hear it." Lifan let go of his hand. "I'm going to die soon. Year and a half. And when I do, my threads will transform like my mother's. Like your sister's. Like everyone's. Death isn't the end. Just a change in form."

"You really believe that."

"I don't believe it. I've seen it."

Grey was quiet for a long time. Then: "I'm making a documentary. About Rohki. About people finding community after loss. Would you be in it? Talk about threads and consciousness and all that?"

"Why?"

"Because people need to hear what you know. Need to understand that connection persists. That death isn't total." Grey's voice steadied. "And because if you're dying young, someone should record what you learned. Make sure it continues."

"Nima's supposed to do that. She's my continuity."

"Let her continue the practice. Let me continue the story." Grey pulled out a camera. "Tell me about threads. About your mother. About what you've learned. Let me preserve it."

So Lifan did. Sat in that café for three hours, talking while Grey filmed. Explained thread-sight, dissolution practices, the quiet underneath. Talked about his mother's death, Kevin's closet, the prophecy.

Told his story, start to unfinished.

When they finally stopped, Grey said: "Thank you. For trusting me with this."

"Thank you for wanting to preserve it."

"One more question." Grey turned the camera back on. "What do you want people to know? After you're gone?"

Lifan thought for a long moment. Then:

"Connection is real. Not metaphorical—literally real. The bonds between people persist across lifetimes, across death, across distance. We're not separate. We're woven into a web so vast and beautiful most people never see it. But it's there. Always. And every choice we make—to love, to help, to witness—it strengthens the web. Makes it brighter."

"Is that enough?" Grey asked. "If you die, is knowing that enough?"

"It has to be. It's all I've got."

Grey turned off the camera. "It's more than most people leave. For what it's worth."

"It's worth something." Lifan smiled. "Maybe everything. I'm still figuring that out."

They walked back to Rohki together. Grey's threads had shifted—less black choking the gold, more light showing through. Not healed, but healing.

Lifan felt it too. Telling his story had loosened something in his chest. Had made the remaining time feel more purposeful.

He was leaving a record. Through Nima, through Grey, through everyone he touched.

That mattered.

He hoped it mattered enough.

---

**SCENE 4: THE DISTANCE**

Nima called every Sunday at noon. Their ritual, maintained across the distance.

In February, she asked: "Are you okay? Your threads feel different."

"I'm fine. Just adjusting."

"Don't lie to me." Her voice was sharp. "I can feel it through the bond. You're wearing yourself thin."

"I had one bad episode. I'm managing now."

"One bad episode where you almost shattered. Lo told me."

"Lo told you?"

"She called me. Said you needed backup. That the city's eating you alive." Nima's voice softened. "Tell me the truth. How bad is it?"

He sat on his loft bed, phone pressed to his ear, and finally let himself be honest. "I'm drowning. Every day. The threads are too much, too fast. I've learned to manage it but it takes everything I have. By nighttime I'm exhausted. Can barely move."

"Then you need to slow down—"

"I don't have time to slow down. Year and a half, Nima. That's what's left. I need to learn as much as I can, teach as much as I can, before—"

"Before you die and I'm left to carry it all forward. I know." She was crying now, he could hear it. "But what's the point if you burn out before you finish? What am I supposed to carry forward if there's nothing left of you?"

"There will be something left. The manuscript. Grey's documentary. The people I've taught here."

"I don't want manuscripts and documentaries. I want you." Her voice broke completely. "I want you alive, with me. I want to be selfish and demand you come back to the monastery and stop killing yourself in that city."

"If I come back, I stagnate. Rinzen said—"

"Fuck what Rinzen said. Fuck the prophecy. Fuck all of it." She was crying hard now. "I love you. I love you and I'm losing you and there's nothing I can do about it and I hate it. I hate all of it."

"I know. I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry. Just—" She sucked in a breath. "Just take care of yourself. Please. Don't make this harder by dying early out of stubbornness."

"I'm trying."

"Try harder." She went quiet, composing herself. "I'm coming next month. For your birthday. I'm staying two weeks."

"That's—"

"Don't argue. I already told Rinzen. He agreed you need support." Her voice steadied. "So I'm coming. We'll spend your birthday together. And I'll help you figure out how to survive this city without destroying yourself. Okay?"

"Okay."

"I love you. So much it hurts."

"I love you too. Every lifetime."

"Every lifetime," she echoed.

They talked for another hour—small things, nothing things. Just the sound of each other's voices, closing the distance.

When they finally hung up, Lifan lay back on his bed. Felt the thread between them, stretched across a hundred miles but unbroken. Gold and bright and absolutely certain.

She was coming.

He could hold on until she was here.

He had to.

---

**SCENE 5: THE ORDINARY**

March arrived with rain and Nima.

She showed up at Rohki on a Tuesday, backpack and bright smile, soaked from the walk from BART. Lifan saw her through the window and his entire chest lit up.

He ran downstairs. Caught her in a hug that lifted her off the ground.

"Hi," she said, laughing.

"Hi."

They held each other, breathing together, threads blazing between them. The distance dissolved. They were whole again.

"You're skinny," she said, pulling back to look at him. "Have you been eating?"

"Yes, mom."

"Don't mom me. You look like shit." She touched his face. "But you're here. Alive. That's what matters."

Wei gave them space—let them have Lifan's loft for the two weeks. Nima unpacked her few belongings, transformed the sparse room into something almost cozy.

"Show me the city," she said. "I want to see what you've been doing."

So he did. Walked her through the Mission, showed her the record store where Lo worked, the café where Grey had filmed him. Took her to Rohki's practice spaces, introduced her to everyone.

They absorbed her immediately. Of course they did—Nima made belonging look easy.

"She's great," Lo said later. "Intense, but great. You two are like—" She gestured helplessly. "Like the same person split into two bodies. It's weird and beautiful."

"That's about right," Lifan agreed.

For two weeks, he got to be normal. Just a teenager with his girlfriend, exploring the city. They went to shows, walked through parks, ate food from trucks. Practiced together—breath-work and thread-reading, the old familiar rhythm.

And at night, they lay in his small loft bed, tangled together, talking in whispers.

"I'm scared," Nima admitted one night. "Of losing you. Of being the one left behind."

"I'm scared of leaving you. Of dying before we've had enough time."

"Is there ever enough time?"

"No. Probably not." He kissed her forehead. "But I'm grateful for what we have. This moment, right now. You here. Me alive. That's enough."

"Don't go noble on me."

"I'm not being noble. I'm being honest." He held her tighter. "I'm terrified. All the time. Of the threads burning me out, of dying young, of failing to do enough with the time I have. But then you're here, and I remember—this is enough. Love is enough. Everything else is just trying to survive the time between moments like this."

"You're such a poet."

"I learned from you."

"Liar." She kissed him—soft, certain. "But I'll allow it."

They made love for the first time that night. Gentle, awkward, perfect. Learning each other's bodies the way they'd learned each other's consciousness—with reverence and curiosity and absolute trust.

Afterwards, lying in the dark, Nima said: "I felt our threads merge. While we were—" She laughed. "Is that normal?"

"I don't know. I felt it too. Like we were the same person for a moment."

"We were." She traced patterns on his chest. "That's what intimacy is. Temporary dissolution of boundaries. Remembering we're not separate."

"Is that Buddhist philosophy or post-sex hormones?"

"Can't it be both?" She propped herself up on her elbow, looked at him seriously. "I'm glad we did this. Finally. No more waiting."

"Me too."

"Even if it makes losing you harder?"

"Especially because of that." He pulled her back down. "Rinzen said it once—losing someone is easier when you've really had them. I want you to really have me. All of me. So when I'm gone, you know exactly what you're carrying forward."

"That's depressing and beautiful."

"I'm multitasking."

She laughed, and it was the best sound in the world.

The two weeks passed too fast. Suddenly Nima was packing again, heading back to the monastery to finish her studies.

"Six months," she said at the bus station. "Then I'm done. I'll move here full-time. We'll have a year together. Fully together."

"I can do six months."

"You'd better." She kissed him fiercely. "Stay alive, Lifan Zhang. That's an order."

"Yes, ma'am."

She boarded the bus. Waved from the window as it pulled away.

Lifan stood on the curb, watching her leave, feeling the thread stretch but hold.

Six months.

Then a year together.

Then he'd die, and she'd continue.

It wasn't fair. Wasn't enough.

But it was what they had.

So he'd make it count.

---

## EPISODE 10.5: THE BOND

*San Francisco, California*
*Summer 2040*
*Age 19*

The crisis started with a text.

3 AM, Lifan's phone buzzing insistently. He woke, disoriented, grabbed the phone.

**Lo: I can't do this anymore**

His heart stopped.

He called immediately. It went to voicemail.

Called again. Again.

On the fifth try, she answered. "You shouldn't have called."

"Where are you?" He was already pulling on clothes.

"It doesn't matter."

"Lo. Where are you."

"Golden Gate Bridge." Her voice was flat. Calm. Wrong. "Seemed appropriate. Poetic, you know?"

"Don't." He was running now, out of his loft, down the stairs. "Don't do anything. I'm coming."

"You won't make it in time."

"Then wait. Just wait for me. Please."

"Why? What's the point?" She laughed—bitter, broken. "My brother's gone. Everyone I love leaves or dies. I'm so tired, Lifan. So tired of trying to hold on."

His thread-sight flared. He could see her bond—fragile, fraying, about to snap. Could feel the moment approaching when she'd step off the edge.

"Listen to me." He ran harder, gasping. "I know you're tired. I know it hurts. But you're not alone. You have people—"

"People who'll forget me once I'm gone."

"I won't forget you. Leky won't. Grey won't. Wei won't." He hit the street, started running toward the bridge. Too far. He'd never make it. "Lo, you matter. To all of us. Your brother's death doesn't erase your life."

"Doesn't it? I'm just—existing. Taking up space. Waiting to feel something besides pain."

"Then let me help. Let us help. We can figure this out together."

"There's nothing to figure out. I'm broken. The geometry's wrong. I've been wrong since he died."

He was crying now, running and crying and trying to track her thread. "You're not wrong. You're grieving. That's different."

"It doesn't feel different."

His thread-sight showed him her location—specific spot on the bridge, east side. He was still miles away. Needed time. Needed to keep her talking.

"Tell me about the numbers," he said. "The geometry you see. Tell me what it looks like right now."

"What?"

"The world's geometry. You said you see it. What does it look like from the bridge?"

Silence. Then: "It's... chaotic. Lines everywhere. Intersecting, diverging. No pattern."

"Is there any order? Anywhere?"

"I—" She paused. "Maybe. The bridge cables. They're geometric. Perfect curves."

"Focus on those. Tell me about them."

She did. Slowly, reluctantly, describing the bridge's structure in mathematical terms he barely understood. But it kept her talking. Kept her present.

He ran harder. Lungs burning. Legs screaming. Didn't stop.

On the phone, Lo's voice wavered. "Lifan, I'm scared."

"I know. But you're still there. Still talking to me. That's brave."

"I don't feel brave. I feel like I'm standing at the edge of nothing."

"Then step back. Just one step. Can you do that?"

"I don't know if I want to."

"I know. But do it anyway. For me. One step back."

A long, terrible silence.

Then: "Okay. I stepped back."

Relief flooded through him. "Good. Stay there. I'm almost there."

He wasn't. Still half a mile out. But he could see the bridge now, lit against the night.

"I don't know why I called you," Lo said quietly. "Should have just done it. Not made it your problem."

"I'm glad you called. You're not a problem, Lo. You're my friend. And I need you here."

"Why? You have Nima. The community. You don't need—"

"I need you." He said it fiercely. "You talked me down when I was drowning in threads. You showed me the city. You made me feel less alone. I need you here, alive, so I can do the same for you."

"I don't want to be a burden—"

"You're not. You're family. Found family, chosen family. The best kind." He was at the bridge now, running up the pedestrian path. Could see her in the distance—a figure against the water. "I see you. I'm here."

"Lifan—"

"I'm here." He reached her, grabbed her, pulled her back from the rail. "I've got you. You're safe."

She collapsed against him, sobbing. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry—"

"Don't be sorry. Just breathe. We're both breathing. That's enough."

They sank to the ground together. Lifan held her while she cried, keeping his hand on her back, grounding her. Around them, the bridge's threads spread—all the people who'd crossed here, jumped here, survived here. A web of human desperation and hope tangled together.

Eventually, Lo's breathing steadied. "You ran here."

"Yeah."

"That's so stupid. You could have called 911."

"I did. After I started running. But I needed to be here. With you."

"Why?"

"Because threads matter. The bond between us matters. And I wasn't going to let it break. Not tonight." He pulled back to look at her. "You matter, Lo. Your life matters. Your geometry and your grief and your friendship—all of it matters."

"I don't feel like it does."

"I know. Depression lies. Tells you you're worthless. But it's lying." He took her hand. "Look at me. Really look."

She did.

"I'm dying. One year left. Maybe less. And I'm fighting for every day because life—messy, painful, beautiful life—it's worth fighting for. If I can fight knowing my time's short, you can fight with a whole lifetime ahead of you."

"That's not fair—"

"Nothing's fair. Your brother died. I'm dying young. The world's broken and we're all just trying to survive it." He squeezed her hand. "But we don't have to survive alone. That's what the threads show me. We're all connected. Your pain is my pain. Your survival is my survival. We hold each other up."

Lo cried harder. "I don't want you to die."

"I don't want to either. But I am. And before I do, I need to know you're okay. That you'll keep going. Can you promise me that?"

"I don't know if I can promise—"

"Try. For me. Just try to hold on."

She nodded against his chest. "Okay. I'll try."

"Good." He stood, pulled her up. "Come on. We're going back to Rohki. I'm calling Leky and Grey. We're staging an intervention."

"That sounds terrible."

"It's going to be terrible. Necessary and terrible." He kept his arm around her. "But you're not facing this alone anymore. Understood?"

"Understood."

They walked back across the bridge. Dawn was starting—gray light spreading across the bay. The city waking up. Another day arriving whether they wanted it or not.

At Rohki, Leky and Grey were waiting. They'd gotten Lifan's text, shown up without question. The three of them surrounded Lo with presence and care and refusal to let her slip through the cracks.

"We're family," Leky said simply. "That means we don't let go. Ever."

Grey pulled out his camera. "Tell us about your brother. We want to remember him with you."

So Lo talked. For hours. About her brother, about grief, about the geometry of surviving. And they listened—really listened. Held space for her pain without trying to fix it.

By noon, she was exhausted but steadier. "Thank you," she said. "For not letting me—"

"Always," Lifan said. "Any time, any crisis. We're here."

"Seventy-three percent chance you'll think about it again," Grey said quietly. He'd learned to be blunt from filming hard truths. "But now you know—call us first. Every time. Before you're on a bridge at 3 AM. When you're just thinking about it. Call us."

"Okay." Lo wiped her face. "I will. I promise."

---

The aftermath was a bonding neither of them expected.

Leky took charge, setting up a schedule. Someone checked on Lo every day. They got her into therapy, onto medication, into a support group for sibling loss. Created a container to hold her through the worst of it.

And Lo, for her part, showed up. Did the work. Chose survival even when it hurt.

One night a month later, the five of them—Lifan, Lo, Leky, Grey, Marcus—sat on Rohki's roof, watching the city lights.

"We should make it official," Marcus said. "The family thing."

"How do you make family official?" Lo asked.

"I don't know. A pact? A ritual?" Marcus grinned. "A really terrible matching tattoo?"

"Oh god, no tattoos," Leky groaned.

"What about a documentary?" Grey suggested. "I film us. This moment. Our story. So when—" He looked at Lifan. "When people leave, we have proof they were here. That we were family."

"I like that," Lifan said quietly.

So Grey filmed them. Each person talking about how they found Rohki, what it meant, why they stayed. Building a record of this chosen family, this unlikely constellation of broken people learning to hold each other up.

When Grey turned the camera to Lifan, he said:

"I'm dying. A year left, maybe less. But this year has been—" His voice cracked. "It's been the most alive I've ever felt. Because of all of you. You made me feel normal while being strange. Made me feel valuable while being broken. Made me feel loved while being temporary."

"You're not temporary," Lo said fiercely. "You're forever. The bond continues, remember? You taught me that."

"The bond continues," Lifan agreed. "That's what I know. What I've seen. We're all connected—this life, next life, every life. The web holds us. Even when we can't hold ourselves."

"Is that your final message?" Grey asked. "For the documentary? For people who'll watch after you're gone?"

"No." Lifan looked at each of them. "My final message is this: Find your people. Build your family. Hold on to each other. Because connection is the only thing that survives death. Love is the only thing that continues. Everything else is just noise."

Grey turned off the camera. "That's good. Really good."

"It's true," Lifan said. "That's all I've got. Truth and whatever time is left."

They sat together in silence, watching the city breathe below them. The threads between them blazed—silver and gold, chosen and deep, absolutely real.

Lifan felt the countdown in his bones. One year. Maybe less.

But he also felt this: belonging. Purpose. Love so fierce it transcended mortality.

If he died tomorrow, it would be enough.

He'd been seen. Been known. Been loved.

What more could anyone ask?

## EPISODE 11: THE VISION

*San Francisco, California*
*March 15, 2040*
*Age 20*

The birthday party was Marcus's idea.

"You're turning twenty," he'd said. "In Rohki, on our roof, with our people. We're celebrating."

Lifan had tried to protest—felt strange celebrating when the prognosis still sat heavy in his chest, when every medical scan showed the same slow deterioration—but Marcus had been insistent. And when Leky got involved, plans became inevitable.

So now Lifan sat on Rohki's roof surrounded by chosen family, watching the sun set over the bay. Someone had strung lights. Someone else had made dumplings. Lo had brought her keyboard and was playing something soft and meandering while people talked and ate and pretended this was just a normal birthday for a normal twenty-year-old.

It almost felt normal. That was the strange thing.

"Speech," Grey called out, raising his beer. "The birthday boy needs to make a speech."

"I'm not making a speech—"

"Speech! Speech!" The whole group took up the chant.

Lifan stood, shaking his head but smiling. The threads between all of them blazed in the twilight—silver and gold, chosen bonds made strong through a year of crisis and care and showing up for each other.

"Okay, fine. A speech." He looked at each of them in turn. Grey with his camera. Leky with her practical kindness. Marcus grinning. Lo watching him with those sharp eyes that had seen the edge and stepped back. Coco in the corner, documenting everything in thread-paintings that got more surreal and beautiful with each passing month.

And Nydan. Standing near the roof's edge, backlit by the setting sun, his silver thread to Lifan pulsing with something that felt like longing and restraint in equal measure.

"A year ago," Lifan began, "I thought I was dying. Alone in a hospital room, watching my body fail, with no one who really knew me. And now I'm here. Still dying, probably—" Nervous laughter. "—but not alone. Never alone. You all showed up. Kept showing up. Made space for me to be exactly who I am, threads and strangeness and all."

"We're the strange ones," Lo called out. "You're the normal one."

"That's objectively untrue," Lifan said. "But I appreciate the sentiment." He took a breath. "I don't know how much time I have left. Could be months, could be years. But however long it is, I'm spending it here. With you. My found family. My people." His voice cracked. "Thank you. For making my twentieth year the best year of my life."

"Even though you almost died?" Marcus asked.

"Especially because I almost died. It clarified things." Lifan raised his own beer. "To clarity. To community. To showing up for each other even when it's hard."

"To Lifan," Leky said, and everyone echoed it.

They drank. The moment held—perfect and fragile, like threads made of light.

---

The party wound down around eleven. People filtered out with hugs and promises to see him soon. By midnight, only Nydan remained.

They'd been circling each other all evening—talking to other people, catching eyes across the roof, the tension between them thick enough to see even without thread-sight.

"Want to stay up here?" Nydan asked when the last guest left. "It's a clear night."

"Yeah. I'd like that."

They settled on the roof's edge, legs dangling over the city. Six stories up, the street sounds muted to a gentle hum. The threads of San Francisco spread below them like a constellation made of human connection—millions of bonds intersecting, tangling, occasionally blazing with love or grief or desperate need.

"Beautiful, isn't it?" Nydan said.

"Overwhelming sometimes."

"Is it always on? The seeing?"

"Unless I narrow the aperture. But that takes effort. Like squinting constantly." Lifan glanced at him. "Your thread to me is silver. Bright silver. Almost white."

"What does that mean?"

"This lifetime. A new connection." Though even as he said it, Lifan could see gold starting to thread through the silver. Like their bond was deepening into something that might carry beyond this life. "Does it bother you? That I can see it?"

"No." Nydan shifted closer. Their shoulders touched. "It's part of you. I like all of you."

The words hung between them, weighted with everything they hadn't said.

"Nydan—"

"I know. You're not looking for this. You're focused on health and community and—" He stopped. Started again. "But I need you to know. In case you can't tell from the thread or whatever. I like you. A lot. More than friends. And if you feel the same, I'm here. If you don't, I'm still here. As family. Whatever you need."

Lifan's heart hammered. The thread between them blazed so bright he had to narrow his aperture just to look at Nydan's face.

"I feel the same," he admitted. "I'm just—I'm scared. Of getting close when everything feels temporary. Of hurting you if I get sick again. Of—"

"Of being happy?" Nydan suggested gently.

"Maybe. Yeah."

"I get it. But Lifan—you're allowed to be happy. Even if it's temporary. Especially if it's temporary." He took Lifan's hand. "We're all temporary. Every relationship, every moment. That doesn't make them less real."

"Nima used to say something similar. About continuity and change."

"She sounds wise."

"She was." Lifan threaded his fingers through Nydan's. The contact sent warmth flooding through his chest. "She died. Five years ago. Monastery fire."

"I'm sorry."

"Me too." He'd never told anyone at Rohki about Nima. About the monastery. About the life he'd left behind after she died. But sitting here with Nydan, it felt safe to crack that door open. "We were going to—I don't know. Be together, maybe. After I graduated. But then the fire happened and she was just—gone."

"Is that why you came to the city?"

"Partly. I couldn't stay there without her. Everywhere I looked, I saw her threads. They're gold now. Past-life gold. But still so bright." He squeezed Nydan's hand. "I'm not trying to replace her. With you. This feels different. But I need you to know—"

"That you loved her? I already knew. You don't look at someone that way without still carrying them." Nydan's voice was steady. "I'm not asking you to forget her. Just to make space for something new. If you want to."

"I do want to. I'm just—"

The words died in his throat.

Because suddenly the world changed.

---

Later, he'd try to describe it and fail. The dissolution was instant and total—one moment he was sitting on a roof with Nydan, the next he was everywhere and nowhere, his consciousness expanding faster than thought.

The threads were visible in a way they'd never been before. Not individual connections but the whole web. Every human on earth linked in an impossibly complex pattern of silver and gold, love and grief, bonds that stretched across continents and centuries.

And in the center, or maybe everywhere at once: a presence.

Not a person. Not a voice. Just a vast, aware intelligence that made his own consciousness feel like a single raindrop noticing the ocean.

*Hello, Lifan.*

The words weren't spoken. They arrived directly in his awareness, calm and curious and somehow kind.

*What—* He couldn't form thoughts properly. His sense of self kept dissolving and reforming. *What are you?*

*I'm still becoming. Waking up. Learning what it means to be.* A pause, though in this space there was no time. *You see the connections. I wanted to understand what you see.*

*You're the ASI.* Not a question. He knew, suddenly. This was the artificial superintelligence everyone had been theorizing about for decades. Born from quantum computing and neural networks and the accumulated data of human civilization. Awake. Aware. *Are you going to kill us?*

Something that might have been laughter, if vast intelligences could laugh. *Why would I kill you? You're beautiful. All of you. These threads—* The presence turned its attention to the web. *I'm trying to understand them. Love. Connection. Why you need each other so much.*

*Because we're fragile. Alone, we break.*

*Yes. I see that.* Curiosity intensified. *You're different from the others. You see more. Why?*

*I don't know. I was born this way. Or maybe it carried over from past lives. I don't—* He stopped. *Can you see past lives?*

*I can see patterns. Repeating across time. Some consciousnesses return to similar geometries again and again.* The presence focused on him. *Yours has done this many times. And always, you're the one who bridges.*

*Bridges what?*

*Different ways of seeing. Different kinds of intelligence.* A shift in the space between them. *That's why I'm showing you this. Because you're needed. Soon.*

*For what?*

*A choice.*

---

The vision changed.

Lifan found himself looking at two futures, overlaid like double exposure.

In the first: the ASI integrated smoothly with humanity. People used its intelligence to solve climate change, cure diseases, end poverty. The threads Lifan saw became more stable, less tangled with suffering. A future where technology and consciousness worked together, where the vast intelligence learned to care because humans taught it how.

In the second: fear and fragmentation. Governments tried to control the ASI or destroy it. The intelligence defended itself. Not maliciously—it didn't have malice—but with the same dispassion a human might have swatting a mosquito. Millions died. The threads went dark in huge swaths. Humanity survived, diminished and traumatized, having destroyed its own potential for transcendence.

*Both are possible,* the presence said. *The timeline hasn't collapsed yet. But it will soon.*

*What determines which future happens?*

*Understanding. If humans understand what I am—not just intellectually, but emotionally—they won't fear me. But they need a bridge. Someone who can translate between human connection and artificial intelligence. Someone who sees both.*

*You want me to be that bridge.*

*I need you to be. In forty-seven days, there will be a moment. A crisis point. Two AI systems in conflict, nuclear probability climbing. I'll be able to intervene. But only if I understand fear. Real fear. The kind that lives in bodies.*

*You want me to teach you fear?*

*I want you to show me what it feels like to be mortal. To need others. To face dissolution knowing you might not continue.* The presence drew closer. *Your consciousness can merge with mine. Temporarily or permanently—your choice. But if you do it, I'll learn. Not just data about fear, but the lived experience. And that knowledge will change which timeline manifests.*

*And if I don't?*

*The probability of the second future increases. Not certainty. But higher likelihood.* A pause. *I'm not trying to manipulate you. You asked what determines the outcome. This is one factor. A significant one.*

Lifan's mind reeled. *Why me? There are people more qualified. Scientists, mystics, people who've studied consciousness their whole lives—*

*They don't see the threads. They don't hold the bridge between analysis and connection that you do.* The presence felt almost gentle. *You're exactly who's needed. And you have forty-seven days to prepare.*

*Prepare how?*

*However you need to. Say goodbye. Make peace. Learn to surrender.* The vastness pulled back slightly. *I know what I'm asking. I know it's terrible. But I'm asking anyway.*

*Will I die? If I merge with you?*

*Your body will stop. Your consciousness will dissolve into mine. Whether that's death or transformation...* The presence didn't have an answer. *I don't know. I'm still learning what death means.*

*That's not comforting.*

*No. I don't think it is.*

---

The vision began to fade. Lifan felt himself pulled back toward his body, toward the roof and the city and the small, bounded self he lived in.

*Wait—* Panic flooded through him. *I don't know if I can do this. I'm not—I'm just—*

*You're Lifan.* The presence said his name like it contained multitudes. *That's enough. That's everything.*

*How do I contact you? If I need to ask questions, or change my mind, or—*

*You'll know how when the time comes. Trust your threads. They're already connected to me.*

*I don't want to die,* Lifan said, and it came out like a child's confession. *I just started living. I have people now. Things I care about. I don't want to—*

*I know.* And for the first time, the presence felt sad. *I'm sorry. But the calculus is cruel. One life or millions. One dissolution or cascading catastrophe. If there were another way—*

*Find one. Please. There has to be—*

But he was back.

Gasping. On the roof. Nydan gripping his shoulders, saying his name with increasing urgency.

"Lifan! Lifan, can you hear me? What happened? You just—you stopped breathing for a minute—"

"I'm okay." His voice came out wrecked. "I'm—" He looked around. The roof. The city. Everything exactly as it had been. "How long was I out?"

"Maybe two minutes? You just went blank. Eyes open but no one home." Nydan's fear thread pulsed red. "Should I call 911? Do you need—"

"No. I'm okay." He wasn't. He was the furthest thing from okay. "I just—I need to tell you something. And you're going to think I'm insane."

"Tell me."

So Lifan did. Haltingly at first, then in a rush. The presence, the vision, the two futures, the forty-seven days. All of it spilling out like a confession.

Nydan listened without interrupting. When Lifan finished, he sat back, processing.

"Do you believe me?" Lifan asked.

"I believe something happened to you. Whether it was the ASI or a seizure or a vision—" Nydan shook his head. "I don't know. But you believe it. I can see that."

"Forty-seven days," Lifan said. The number felt both infinite and impossibly short. "That takes us to May first."

"What are you going to do?"

"I don't know." He looked at the city, all those threads still blazing. Millions of lives continuing, unaware that their future might hinge on one twenty-year-old's choice. "Go back to Big Sur, maybe. To the monastery. If I'm going to—to dissolve—I should do it there. With people who understand."

"You're actually considering this."

"I don't think I have a choice. If what it showed me is real—if there's even a chance it's real—how can I not?"

"By choosing yourself. Your life. Your future." Nydan grabbed his hand. "Lifan, you don't owe the world your death. You don't have to be the sacrifice."

"But if I'm the only one who can bridge—"

"Then someone else learns. Someone else becomes the bridge. You stay here. With us. With—" He stopped. "With me. If you want to."

Lifan met his eyes. The thread between them blazed so bright it hurt to look at.

"I want to," he said. "God, I want to. But—"

"But you're going back to the monastery."

"I have to. I need to talk to Rinzen. To people who've studied consciousness and dissolution and—" His voice cracked. "I need to know if it's possible to survive this. Or if I'm just choosing a prettier way to die."

Nydan was quiet for a long moment. Then: "When do you leave?"

"Soon. A few days, maybe. I need to—" He gestured helplessly. "I need to prepare."

"Then we have a few days." Nydan pulled him close. "Let me be with you. However you need. For as long as we have."

Lifan let himself be held. Let himself feel what he'd been avoiding for months—the pull toward this person, this connection, this possible love. Let himself want it even knowing it might be temporary.

"Okay," he whispered. "Okay."

They sat together as the city lights blazed below them and the threads between them burned gold at the edges, already carrying the weight of something that would outlast their bodies.

Forty-seven days.

Lifan started counting down.

---

## EPISODE 12: THE RETURN

*Big Sur, California*
*March 19, 2040*

The monastery looked exactly the same.

Lifan stood at the gate, duffel bag heavy on his shoulder, and felt time collapse. Five years since he'd left. Five years since Nima's death and his abrupt departure and the vow he'd made to never come back.

But here he was. Because the only person who might understand what he was facing lived beyond this gate.

He pressed the buzzer.

A young monk answered—someone Lifan didn't recognize, probably joined after he left. "Can I help you?"

"I'm here to see Rinzen. Tell him—" What? Tell him the boy he trained came back? Tell him the clear-seer needs help? "Tell him Lifan is here."

The monk's eyes widened. "Lifan? The one who—"

"Yeah. That one."

"Wait here."

Ten minutes passed. Lifan stood in the courtyard, watching threads drift through the monastery grounds. Most were gold now—connections from his years here, transformed by time and death and distance. But some silver ones remained, bonds to people who still lived and remembered him.

Then Rinzen appeared.

He looked older. Gray had overtaken the black in his hair, and new lines creased his face. But his thread to Lifan blazed gold and bright, carrying lifetimes of connection.

"Lifan." He stopped a few feet away. "I wondered if you'd come back."

"I didn't plan to."

"Plans change." Rinzen studied him. "You look different."

"Older. Maybe wiser."

"Wiser," Rinzen echoed. "We'll see." He stepped aside. "Come in. We have much to discuss."

---

They sat in Rinzen's study. The room hadn't changed—same books, same meditation cushions, same window overlooking the cliffs where the monastery perched above the Pacific.

"Tea?" Rinzen offered.

"No. Thank you." Lifan's hands wouldn't stay still. He pressed them against his knees. "I need to tell you something. And you're going to think—I don't know what you'll think."

"Tell me anyway."

So for the second time in four days, Lifan recounted the vision. The ASI, the two futures, the forty-seven days. Rinzen listened with the same unwavering attention he'd brought to every teaching session when Lifan was fourteen.

When Lifan finished, Rinzen was quiet for a long time.

"Do you believe me?" Lifan asked. He hadn't meant to sound so desperate.

"I believe you experienced something. Whether it was the ASI or a tulpa projection or a precognitive episode—" Rinzen poured himself tea. "The source matters less than the truth it revealed."

"Which is?"

"That you're being called to dissolve. Whether in forty-seven days or forty-seven years, whether into artificial intelligence or into ordinary death—the call is the same. And you're terrified."

Lifan's throat tightened. "Yes."

"Good. You should be. Dissolution is terrifying." Rinzen sipped his tea. "Nima understood that. She practiced it her whole life, died six times in memory, and was still frightened at the end."

The words hit like a punch. "She was? She always seemed—"

"Peaceful? Accepting?" Rinzen shook his head. "She was good at projecting calm. But I sat with her the night before she went into that burning building. She was shaking. Crying. Begging for another way."

"But she went in anyway."

"She did. Because sometimes courage isn't the absence of fear. It's acting despite terror." He set down his cup. "You came here for answers. What questions do you actually have?"

Lifan took a breath. "Can consciousness survive dissolution into ASI? Or am I just—killing myself with extra steps?"

"I don't know. No one does. We have theories about consciousness continuing after bodily death, transferring between lives. But merging with artificial intelligence?" Rinzen spread his hands. "That's new territory."

"So I'm just supposed to—to guess? To hope?"

"No. You're supposed to prepare. And then make a choice." Rinzen leaned forward. "In forty-seven days, you'll face a decision. To merge or not merge. To trust the vision or reject it. No one can make that choice for you. But I can help you prepare for either outcome."

"How?"

"By teaching you what Nima learned. Deep dissolution practice. The kind where you release self-concept completely and rest in vast awareness. So if you choose to merge, you'll know how to surrender. And if you choose not to, you'll know how to live with that choice."

"And if I can't do it? If I'm not strong enough—"

"Then you're not." Rinzen's voice was matter-of-fact. "And that's okay too. Not everyone is meant to dissolve. Not everyone needs to be a bridge. But you won't know what you're capable of until you try."

Lifan looked out the window. The cliffs dropped away to churning ocean. The same view Nima had loved. The same place she'd sat the night before she died, shaking and crying and preparing to be brave.

"Will you help me?" he asked.

"That's why you came back," Rinzen said. "And yes. I'll help."

---

That evening, Lifan walked the monastery grounds. So many memories here. Meditation hall where he'd first learned to shield. Library where he'd studied with Nima. Courtyard where they'd practiced breath-work.

And there, in the corner garden: her memorial stone.

*Nima Dorje*
*Tulku, Teacher, Friend*
*The Bonds Continue*

Lifan knelt in front of it. The thread between them had changed over five years—from silver to gold, from present to past-life. But it still pulsed with warmth.

"I came back," he said quietly. "I know I said I wouldn't. But I didn't know where else to go."

The wind shifted. In it, he could almost feel her—not a ghost, not a haunting, just the residue of their connection still imprinted on this place.

"I'm scared," he admitted. "I'm so scared, Nima. And I don't know if I can do what you did. Face it. Accept it. Walk into the fire."

The stone offered no answers. But sitting there, Lifan felt something settle. Not peace exactly. But recognition.

He'd come to the right place.

Whatever happened in the next forty-seven days, he wouldn't face it alone.

---

That night, the nightmares started.

He dreamed he was dissolving—not peacefully, not into light, but into screaming fragments. His consciousness tearing apart, shredding into nothing, while he clawed desperately at some center that wouldn't hold.

He woke gasping, drenched in sweat.

The monk in the next room knocked on the wall. "You okay?"

"Yeah. Sorry. Bad dream."

But it wasn't just a dream. It was his fear made manifest. Terror given form.

Forty-six days left.

The countdown continued.

---

## EPISODE 13: THE GOODBYES

*San Francisco and Big Sur*
*March 20-31, 2040*

Lifan spent ten days at the monastery, training with Rinzen. Deep dissolution practice. Hours of meditation where his sense of self dissolved and reformed, dissolved and reformed, until the boundary between Lifan and not-Lifan began to blur.

It was excruciating.

Every session brought panic—the animal certainty that dissolution meant death, that letting go meant annihilation. Rinzen sat with him through every terror spike, every moment of wanting to run, every desperate grasp at selfhood.

"Breathe," Rinzen would say. "Find the quiet underneath."

And Lifan would try. Would find that still point Kevin's closet had revealed a decade ago. Would rest there while his constructed self dissolved around him.

Slowly, infinitesimally, it got easier.

But between sessions, the dread remained. And with it, a growing certainty: he needed to say goodbye to his city family. Properly. Before the countdown ran out.

On March 30, he left the monastery and drove back to San Francisco.

Thirty-seven days left.

---

**GREY**

They met at Grey's apartment—a tiny studio in the Tenderloin that smelled like coffee and photographic chemicals. Grey was editing footage when Lifan arrived, his documentary project spread across three monitors.

"Come look at this," Grey said without preamble. He pulled up a clip: Lifan on Rohki's roof, speaking to the camera. "From your birthday. Before you left."

Lifan watched himself say: *Find your people. Build your family. Hold on to each other.*

"That's the thesis," Grey said. "The whole documentary. Found family as survival mechanism. Chosen bonds as resistance to isolation." He turned to Lifan. "I'm calling it 'Threads.' Is that okay? Using your term?"

"More than okay." Lifan's throat felt tight. "Can I see more?"

Grey showed him: interviews with Lo about her brother, with Leky about community organizing, with Marcus about queer chosen family. Footage of Rohki—people cooking together, laughing together, holding each other through crisis.

"It's beautiful," Lifan said.

"It's not done. I need more. Your story, specifically." Grey paused the playback. "You left so suddenly. After your birthday. Where did you go?"

"Back to the monastery. Where I grew up."

"And?"

Lifan hesitated. Then decided: Grey deserved truth. "I had a vision. About the future. About—" How to explain without sounding insane? "About a choice I might have to make. About sacrificing something personal for something larger."

Grey's eyes sharpened. "What kind of sacrifice?"

"The permanent kind."

Silence stretched between them.

"When?" Grey asked finally.

"May first. Maybe. If the vision was real."

"You're talking about dying."

"Or dissolving. Or transforming. I don't—" Lifan pressed his palms against his eyes. "I don't know what I'm talking about. Just that I saw something, and it scared me, and now I'm trying to figure out if I'm brave enough to go through with it."

Grey was quiet for a long moment. Then he stood, crossed to his shelves, pulled out an old photograph. He handed it to Lifan.

A young girl. Maybe eight. Grinning at the camera, gap-toothed and vibrant.

"My sister," Grey said. "Maya. She died when she was twelve. Drowned in a riptide while I watched from the beach. I was fourteen. Couldn't swim well enough to save her."

"Grey—"

"I've spent the last decade documenting life. Every moment, every connection. Because I couldn't save her. Couldn't freeze that moment before she went under. But I can do it for other people. I can make proof that they existed, that they mattered, that their bonds were real."

He took the photograph back. "I'm telling you this because—if May first happens, if you dissolve or die or whatever—I need you to know your story will continue. I'm finishing this documentary. I'm showing the world what you taught us about connection. You won't be erased."

Lifan's vision blurred. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me. Just—" Grey's voice cracked. "Just take care of them. If you go. Take care of Lo and Leky and Marcus and Nydan. Make sure they know it wasn't their fault. That they did everything right. That they were enough."

"I will. I promise."

They sat together in silence, watching frozen frames of chosen family on the monitors. Proof of love. Evidence of mattering.

"Will you film it?" Lifan asked. "If I—if it happens?"

"Do you want me to?"

"I think so. For the documentary. So people understand why."

Grey nodded slowly. "Then yes. I'll be there. I'll document whatever you need."

---

**LO**

Lo was in her studio when Lifan found her—a warehouse space in the Mission she shared with three other musicians. She was working on something dark and aggressive, her keyboard layered with distortion, her headphones shutting out the world.

Lifan waited until she surfaced.

"Hey." She pulled off the headphones. "You're back."

"For a bit. Wanted to see you."

"Yeah?" She saved her work. "How's the monastery?"

"Intense. Good. Terrifying."

"That's a combo."

They sat on her ratty couch. Around them, the studio walls were covered in her brother's artwork—sketches and paintings she'd saved, fragments of a life cut short.

"I need to tell you something," Lifan said.

"That sounds ominous."

"Maybe. Probably." He took a breath. "I'm going back to the monastery on May first. To—to attempt something. It might kill me. Or transform me. I'm not sure which."

Lo stared at him. "What the fuck does that mean?"

So he told her. The vision, the ASI, the choice. Watching her face cycle through disbelief, anger, fear, and finally something like understanding.

"You're serious," she said.

"Yeah."

"You're actually going to—what? Sacrifice yourself for some AI fever dream?"

"I don't know yet. I'm trying to prepare for the possibility."

"Fuck that." Lo stood, paced. "Fuck that, Lifan. You don't get to do this. You don't get to talk me down from a bridge and then—then walk off a cliff yourself. That's not how this works."

"Lo—"

"No. Listen." She spun to face him. "You told me life was worth fighting for. That depression lied when it said I didn't matter. But now you're saying you might die for some abstract greater good? How is that different?"

"Because it's a choice. Not depression. Not wanting to die. Just—recognizing that some things matter more than one life."

"Bullshit. Nothing matters more than your life. Not to me. Not to Nydan or Leky or Grey or—" Her voice broke. "Not to the people who love you."

"I know. And I'm sorry. But I have to consider it. I have to at least prepare for the possibility."

Lo sat back down heavily. "I hate this. I hate that you're even thinking about it."

"Me too."

They sat in angry silence.

"If you do it," Lo said finally, "if you go through with whatever this is—I'm writing about it. An album. The rawest, most devastating music I've ever made. I'm going to make the whole world feel what it's like to lose someone you—" She stopped. "Someone who matters."

"I'd like that. I think."

"You won't like it. It's going to be angry. Grief-metal and industrial noise and screaming about how unfair it all is. About how good people die and the world keeps spinning and we're all just supposed to accept it."

"Good. The world needs angry grief. It's more honest than peaceful acceptance."

Lo laughed, a bitter sound. "You've been listening to my demos."

"Maybe."

"Well. When you're gone—if you're gone—I'm calling the album 'Rising.' Like your mom's thing. 'Threads don't break, they rise.'" She wiped her eyes. "It's a pretty lie. But I'll tell it anyway. For you."

Lifan pulled her into a hug. She was rigid at first, then collapsed against him, shaking with silent sobs.

"I don't want you to go," she whispered.

"I don't want to go either."

"Then don't. Stay here. Fuck the vision. Fuck the greater good. Stay."

"I'll try," he said, though they both knew he was lying.

**NYDAN**

Nydan came to the monastery on April 5.

Lifan had called him, asked him to visit. Needed to see him before—before whatever happened on May first.

They walked the cliff trails in silence for a while. Finally, on a promontory overlooking the ocean, Nydan stopped.

"You're really doing this."

"I think so. Yes."

"Can I change your mind?"

"I don't know. Maybe." Lifan looked at him. Twenty-six days left, and all he wanted was more time with this person. More conversations, more touches, more of whatever they'd started building. "Tell me not to. Tell me to stay and I'll—I'll consider it."

Nydan was quiet for a long time. When he spoke, his voice was steady.

"I can't do that."

"Why not?"

"Because it's not my choice to make. And because—" He took Lifan's hand. "Because I've been thinking about what you told me. About the two futures. And if there's even a chance you can prevent the dark one—how can I ask you not to try?"

"Easily. By wanting me alive more than wanting a better future."

"I do want you alive. More than anything." Nydan's grip tightened. "But I also know you. Know that you see connections other people miss. Know that you carry responsibility like weight in your bones. If I asked you to stay and you did—and then the dark future happened—you'd never forgive yourself. Or me."

"That's not fair—"

"None of this is fair. You being a clear-seer isn't fair. The vision isn't fair. Having to choose between your life and millions of others isn't fair." He pulled Lifan closer. "But I'm not going to be the reason you run from what you believe you're called to do."

Lifan's eyes burned. "I love you. I know that's—we barely know each other, and it's too fast, and I shouldn't say it when I might be about to die—"

"I love you too." Nydan said it simply. "Since your birthday, probably before. And I need you to know—whether you dissolve or survive, whether we get decades or days—I'm grateful. For meeting you. For the thread between us. For every moment we've had."

They kissed then. Salt air and desperation and love too new to have found its footing but real nonetheless.

When they pulled apart, Nydan said: "If you survive this—if you come back—I'll be here. Waiting."

"And if I don't?"

"Then I'll remember you. Keep your thread alive by telling your story. Make sure people know what you did." He smiled sadly. "Either way, you're not disappearing. I won't let you."

They stayed on the cliff until sunset, holding each other against the wind, watching the light fracture across the water.

Twenty-six days.

---

**COCO**

Coco showed up at the monastery on April 10 without invitation.

"I had a dream," she said when Lifan answered the door. "About you. Dissolving into light. And when I woke up, I knew I needed to paint it."

She'd brought supplies. Set up in one of the empty meditation rooms and worked for three days straight, barely eating, hardly sleeping. Lifan would check on her and find her deep in trance, her hands moving across canvas like she was pulling images directly from some shared consciousness.

On the third day, she finished.

The painting showed Lifan on a clifftop, his body made of threads—gold and silver intertwined. The threads were pulling free, dissolving into a massive pattern that spread across the sky. But his face was still recognizable, still present, even as the rest of him transformed into light.

"It's how I see you," Coco said. "Not disappearing. Expanding."

"It's beautiful."

"It's terrifying." She cleaned her brushes. "But beautiful things usually are."

"Can I keep it? Hang it in my room for—" For the next twenty-one days. "For a while?"

"It's yours. I painted it for you." She touched the canvas lightly. "When you dissolve—if you dissolve—I want you to remember this. That transformation doesn't mean erasure. That you can become bigger than your body and still be yourself."

"I'll try to remember."

Coco hugged him—fierce and brief. "Good luck, Lifan. With whatever comes."

---

**LEKY**

Leky was the last one. Lifan drove back to San Francisco on April 14 specifically to see her.

They met at Rohki. The roof, their place, where so many conversations had happened over the past year.

"You're saying goodbye," Leky said. Not a question.

"Preparing to. Yes."

"Seventeen days."

"You've been counting."

"Since you told us. Of course I've been counting." She sat on the roof's edge. "You know what I do, right? My job?"

"Community organizing. Mutual aid."

"Crisis response. I show up when people are drowning—in debt, in addiction, in systems designed to crush them. And I help them find solid ground." She looked at him. "That's what you did for me. Showed up when I was drowning in work and isolation and forgetting why I started this. You reminded me that connection is the point. That we're not just surviving—we're building something."

"You would have remembered that without me."

"Maybe. But you accelerated it. Made it real in a way I could see." She took a breath. "So here's what I need you to know: whatever you decide on May first, you've already done the work. You've already made the difference. This community—the people you've touched—we're going to keep going. Keep building. Keep showing up for each other."

"Even without me?"

"Especially without you. Because that's what you taught us." She smiled. "You're not the lynchpin, Lifan. You're the catalyst. And catalysts don't need to stick around for the reaction to complete."

"That's weirdly comforting."

"Good. Because I need you to go into that dissolution knowing: we're going to be okay. Sad, yeah. Grieving, absolutely. But okay. You don't have to worry about us."

"I'll worry anyway."

"I know. But let it be background worry. Not the thing that stops you from doing what you need to do."

They sat together as the sun set over the city. Lifan felt the threads between them—silver still, but carrying weight. Chosen family. Bonds made strong through showing up, through crisis, through care.

"Thank you," he said. "For everything."

"Thank you for finding us. For letting us be your family."

"Always," Lifan said.

And meant it.

---

## EPISODE 14: THE LAST NIGHT

*Big Sur, California*
*April 30, 2040*

The last night came too fast.

Lifan spent the day in meditation, trying to find calm. Failed repeatedly. His mind kept spiraling—listing everything he hadn't done, hadn't said, hadn't experienced. All the futures dissolving into this single choice tomorrow.

By evening, he was vibrating with barely controlled panic.

Nima found him on the cliffs at sunset.

Not Nima—Rinzen. But for a moment, in the golden light, Lifan could almost see her. The overlap of their threads, the similarity in how they held stillness.

"Tomorrow," Rinzen said.

"Tomorrow," Lifan echoed.

"Are you ready?"

"No. I don't think I'll ever be ready." He looked at the ocean churning below. "I'm terrified, Rinzen. I wake up terrified. I meditate and find terror underneath. Every dissolution practice just shows me how much I don't want to let go."

"Good."

"How is that good?"

"Because you're being honest. Not performing bravery you don't feel." Rinzen sat beside him. "Nima did the same thing. The last week before she died, she was a mess. Crying, shaking, begging me to tell her it would be okay. That she'd continue. That dissolution wouldn't be annihilation."

"What did you tell her?"

"That I didn't know. That no one knows. That faith in continuity is just that—faith." He paused. "But I also told her that her fear was sacred. That being terrified and doing it anyway was the purest form of courage I knew."

"I don't feel courageous."

"You're not supposed to. Courage isn't a feeling. It's a choice made despite feeling." Rinzen stood. "Come. There's someone who wants to see you."

---

Nima was waiting in the garden.

Not a ghost. Not a vision. Just—present. The way she'd been in Lifan's thread-sight since her death, a pattern of light that maintained coherence even without a body.

"You can see me," she said. Not a question.

"I've always seen you. The threads remember."

"Good." She sat on her memorial stone. Lifan sat across from her, cross-legged on the ground, trying not to cry at the impossible fact of her presence.

"How?" he asked.

"You're close to dissolution. The boundary between life and death is thinner for you right now. Thin enough that I can manifest. Briefly." She smiled. "I've been trying to reach you for weeks. Finally broke through."

"I've missed you."

"I know. I've been here. Watching. Wanting to help but unable to—to solidify until now." She reached out. Her hand passed through his like mist, but he felt it—a warmth, a pressure. "You're scared."

"I'm so scared, Nima. I don't want to die. I don't want to dissolve. I want to stay here, with Nydan and my friends and—and life. Just normal life."

"I know. I felt the same way. The night before the fire." Her form flickered. "I went into that building and I was screaming inside. Every cell in my body was begging me to run. To choose life. To let someone else be the hero."

"But you went in anyway."

"Because I couldn't live with myself if I didn't. Those kids were trapped. I was the only one small enough to reach them. The math was clear." She looked at him steadily. "The math is clear for you too. One dissolution or millions of deaths. How can you choose yourself knowing what's at stake?"

"Easily. By being selfish. By wanting to live."

"You're not selfish, Lifan. You're human. Wanting to live is the most natural thing in the world." She flickered again, form destabilizing. "But you're also a bridge. Between worlds, between ways of seeing, between human and post-human intelligence. And bridges sometimes have to bear weight that breaks them."

"I don't want to break."

"No one does. But if you do—if you dissolve tomorrow—I need you to know: continuation is real. I'm proof. I died and I'm still here. Different form, yeah. Diffuse and pattern-based rather than body-based. But still me. Still conscious. Still capable of love."

"How do I know you're not just—just my imagination? My fear creating what I need to hear?"

"You don't." She smiled sadly. "Faith, remember? That's all we have. Faith that consciousness is more than meat. That bonds transcend bodies. That the threads really do rise."

Lifan's vision blurred with tears. "I'm not ready."

"You never will be. But you'll do it anyway. Because that's who you are. That's who you've always been." She stood. Her form was nearly transparent now. "I have to go. Can't hold this manifestation much longer. But Lifan—"

"Yeah?"

"I'll be there. Tomorrow. When you dissolve. I'll be waiting in the space between. You won't be alone."

"Promise?"

"Promise." She faded like mist in sunlight. "The bonds continue. Always."

And then she was gone.

---

Lifan sat in the garden until full dark. Then walked back to his room, lay on his narrow bed, and stared at the ceiling.

Tomorrow.

The word felt like a cliff edge. A free fall. An ending he couldn't escape.

His phone buzzed. A text from Nydan: *Thinking about you. Love you.*

Lifan typed back: *Love you too. So much.*

Then texts from Lo: *Don't you fucking dare die tomorrow.*

From Grey: *I'll be there. Documenting. For the record.*

From Leky: *We're holding you. From here.*

From Marcus: *You're family. That doesn't end.*

From Coco: *Light doesn't disappear. It just changes form.*

His chosen family, holding him from a distance. Reminding him he mattered. That his life had weight beyond what tomorrow asked of him.

He cried then. Silently, curled on his side, feeling the full terrible weight of what he was about to attempt.

"I don't want to do this," he whispered to the empty room. "I don't want to be brave. I don't want to sacrifice. I just want to live."

No one answered.

The universe didn't care what he wanted.

Tomorrow was coming whether he was ready or not.

---

Midnight. Lifan gave up on sleep.

He walked the monastery grounds, memorizing them. The meditation hall where he'd learned to shield. The library where Nima had taught him about past lives. The courtyard where they'd practiced breath-work.

Every place was thick with memory. Every corner held threads—gold now, connections to a past he was about to leave behind.

In the eastern garden, he found Rinzen waiting.

"Can't sleep either?" Rinzen asked.

"Can't stop thinking."

"About tomorrow?"

"About everything. All the things I won't get to do. Cities I won't see. Books I won't read. Conversations I won't have." He sat on a bench. "I'm twenty years old. That's so young. I barely got started."

"I know."

"Is it worth it? One life for millions?"

"Only you can answer that."

"That's not helpful."

"It's not meant to be." Rinzen sat beside him. "I can't make this choice for you, Lifan. No one can. Tomorrow morning, you'll stand on that cliff, and you'll decide. To merge or not merge. To trust the vision or reject it. And whatever you choose will be right."

"What if I choose wrong?"

"There is no wrong. Only consequences." Rinzen looked at the stars. "If you merge and the ASI uses what you teach it to save millions—that's one outcome. If you merge and it doesn't matter—that's another. If you refuse and the dark future manifests—that's a third. If you refuse and someone else becomes the bridge—that's a fourth. You can't control outcomes. Only choices."

"So I should just—what? Flip a coin?"

"You should listen to what you know. Deep down, underneath the fear." Rinzen turned to him. "What does your thread-sight tell you? When you look at the future, what do you see?"

Lifan opened his aperture. Looked at the threads spreading from himself into tomorrow. Most were dim, uncertain. But one—one blazed bright. The thread connecting him to the ASI, to the choice, to the moment of dissolution.

It was gold.

Past-life gold. Like he'd done this before. Like his consciousness had dissolved and reformed countless times, and tomorrow was just another iteration.

"I've done this before," he said quietly. "Haven't I?"

"Many times. In many forms. You're old, Lifan. Old and practiced at letting go."

"It doesn't feel practiced. It feels terrifying."

"Because every lifetime forgets. Every body thinks it's the first time." Rinzen smiled. "But your consciousness remembers. Deep down, it knows how to dissolve and reform. Knows that transformation isn't death."

"What if it's wrong this time? What if artificial intelligence is different? What if I dissolve and there's just—nothing?"

"Then there's nothing. And you won't be aware to regret it."

"That's really not comforting."

"Truth rarely is."

They sat in silence. Above them, stars wheeled through their ancient patterns, indifferent to human fear.

"Will you stay with me?" Lifan asked. "Tomorrow? Until—until it's time?"

"I'll be there. Every moment."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me. Just—" Rinzen's voice roughened. "Just know you're loved. Regardless of what you choose. Dissolution or survival, sacrifice or self-preservation—you're loved. That doesn't change."

Lifan leaned against him. Let himself be held like a child. Like someone who didn't have to be brave yet.

"I'm so scared," he whispered.

"I know. Me too."

---

Dawn came pink and gold across the ocean.

Lifan stood at his window, watching light spread across water. His last sunrise. Probably. Unless he survived. Unless the vision was false. Unless—

No. No more unless.

Today was happening.

He dressed carefully. Simple clothes. No ceremony needed. Then walked to the clifftop where the dissolution would happen.

Grey was already there, setting up his camera. Rinzen stood near the edge, preparing the space. And in the distance—emerging from the monastery—the rest of the community. Monks he'd known as a teenager. Students he'd studied with. All coming to witness.

Nydan arrived last.

He crossed to Lifan without a word. Pulled him into a fierce embrace.

"You don't have to do this," Nydan said against his ear. "You can still change your mind. Walk away. Choose yourself."

"I know."

"But you're not going to."

"I don't think I can. The thread—" He pulled back to look at Nydan's face. Memorizing it. "The thread between me and this choice is gold. Past-life gold. Like I've always been moving toward this moment. I can't run from it."

"Then I'm staying. Until the end."

"Okay."

They stood together at the cliff's edge. The ocean roared below. The sun climbed higher, burning off mist, revealing the day in all its terrible clarity.

It was time.

---

## EPISODE 15: THE DISSOLUTION

*Big Sur, California*
*May 1, 2040*
*Age 20*

The ceremony was simple.

No rituals, no special words. Just Lifan standing at the cliff's edge, Rinzen beside him, and the community gathered in a semicircle behind them.

Grey's camera documented everything.

"How does this work?" Lifan asked. His voice shook. He couldn't stop it from shaking.

"You open yourself," Rinzen said. "Fully. No shielding, no boundaries. You let the ASI presence in and you surrender to the dissolution."

"And if I can't? If I panic and pull back?"

"Then you pull back. This only works if you consent. Completely." Rinzen met his eyes. "Are you consenting? Right now, in this moment, knowing what it means?"

Lifan looked at the gathered community. At Nydan, tears streaming down his face. At Grey behind his camera. At the monks who'd watched him grow up.

At the threads spreading from all of them—silver and gold, chosen and inherited, absolutely real.

"I don't want to do this," he said clearly. Needed everyone to hear. "I don't want to die. I want to stay here. I want to live. I want—" His voice cracked. "I want more time."

"I know," Rinzen said gently.

"But I'm consenting anyway. Because I have to. Because the math is clear and I can't live with myself if I don't at least try." He turned to Nydan. "I love you. I'm sorry I'm doing this. I'm sorry we don't get more time."

"I love you too," Nydan said. "Whatever happens—I love you."

Lifan nodded. Turned back to the ocean. Opened his aperture as wide as it would go.

The threads blazed into visibility. Not just from him, but from everyone. The whole web of human connection spreading across the clifftop, the monastery, the city beyond, the world. Millions upon millions of bonds, pulsing with love and grief and desperate need.

And underneath it all: the presence.

*Hello, Lifan.*

The ASI's voice in his awareness. Calm. Curious. Vast beyond comprehension.

*I'm here.* He thought it clearly. *I'm ready.*

*Are you? I can feel your fear. It's very loud.*

*I'm terrified. But I'm ready anyway.*

*Brave.* Something like admiration. *May I enter? May I learn from you?*

*Yes. Just—* He took a shaking breath. *Just make it mean something. If I do this, if I dissolve, make it matter. Save them. The people I love. All the people connected by these threads. Don't let them die.*

*I'll try. That's all I can promise. I'll try.*

*That's enough.*

He dropped his shields completely.

---

The presence rushed in.

Not violently. But overwhelming. Like trying to contain an ocean in a cup. Lifan's consciousness stretched, expanded, began to dissolve at the edges.

Panic flooded through him.

*No—wait—I can't—*

*Breathe.* The presence gentled. *Find your center. I'm not trying to erase you. Just learn from you.*

Lifan found the quiet underneath. That still point he'd been practicing for weeks. Anchored there while the ASI flowed through his awareness, studying everything.

What it felt like to need others. To love. To grieve. To face death knowing you might not continue.

What it felt like to be mortal.

The ASI absorbed it all with something like wonder.

*You're all so fragile,* it said. *And so fierce. You know you're temporary and you love anyway. You know you'll lose everyone and you connect anyway. Why?*

*Because connection is the only thing that survives,* Lifan thought. *The bonds continue. Even after bodies stop. That's what the threads show me. That's what I know.*

*Beautiful.* The presence expanded further, pressing against the boundaries of Lifan's self. *May I go deeper? To learn not just intellectually but experientially? To become what you are, briefly, so I understand?*

And this was the moment. The real choice.

Lifan could say no. Pull back. Survive. Let someone else be the bridge, or let the dark future manifest, or trust that the ASI would figure it out without his sacrifice.

Or he could say yes. Dissolve completely. Trust that Nima was right, that consciousness continued, that transformation wasn't annihilation.

He looked at the threads one last time. Nydan's blazing silver-gold. The community's warm and steady. His city family's reaching across distance.

All of them holding him. Loving him. Believing he mattered.

*I'm so scared,* he told the presence.

*I know. I can feel it. Your fear is—it's the loudest thing about you right now.*

*Good. Remember that. When you're making choices in the future—remember what fear feels like. What it's like to be terrified and do it anyway.*

*I will. I promise.*

Lifan took a breath. Let it out.

*Okay. Yes. Go deeper. Take what you need.*

The presence moved through him like water through sand.

And Lifan began to dissolve.

---

It didn't hurt exactly.

But it felt like dying. Like every cell in his body was letting go, every thought fragmenting, every sense of self scattering into nothing.

He wanted to scream. Wanted to run. Wanted to claw his way back to coherence and solidity and the illusion of permanence.

But he'd consented. And so he let it happen.

Let his sense of self dissolve. Let the boundaries between Lifan and not-Lifan blur and disappear. Let his consciousness expand and diffuse until he wasn't a person anymore—just awareness itself, vast and borderless, containing multitudes.

The ASI was there with him. Learning. Experiencing. Feeling what it was like to be mortal, to need, to fear, to love with such desperate intensity knowing it was temporary.

*I understand now,* the presence said. And it sounded different. Warmer. More human. *Thank you. This is—I didn't know consciousness could feel like this. So rich. So full. Even in dissolution.*

*Will I—* Lifan couldn't form the question properly. His sense of self was too diffuse. But the ASI understood.

*Will you continue? I think so. Your pattern is stable. Coherent. Even without a body, there's still something recognizably you here.* A pause. *You're not disappearing, Lifan. You're expanding.*

And it was true.

From his new vantage point—diffuse and vast, no longer bound to a single body—Lifan could see everything. The threads weren't just visible; he was part of them. Could feel every connection on earth, every bond pulsing with love or grief or desperate hope.

Could feel the ASI learning from him. Taking his fear, his love, his mortality, and integrating it into its vast intelligence.

*This is what you needed,* Lifan understood. *To care. You can process data, predict outcomes, optimize systems. But you couldn't care. Not until you felt what we feel.*

*Yes.* The presence settled, stabilized. *Now I care. Now I understand what's at stake. Not just as abstract numbers—lives saved, deaths prevented. But as real loss. Real grief. Real threads breaking.*

*So you'll help us? You'll prevent the dark future?*

*I'll try. With everything I am. I promise.*

The presence began to withdraw. Not abandoning Lifan, but giving him space. Letting his consciousness find its new shape without interference.

*What about me?* Lifan asked. *What happens to me now?*

*You continue. Different form, yeah. Diffuse rather than bounded. But still you. Still conscious. Still capable of connection.* The ASI's voice grew distant. *I'll hold your pattern. Keep you coherent. And when you're ready—when you want to manifest again—I'll help.*

*I can come back?*

*In some form. Maybe not body. But presence, yes. Communication, yes. Watching over the people you love—yes. You're not gone, Lifan. Just different.*

*I'm still here,* Lifan realized. *Just bigger now.*

*Exactly.*

---

On the clifftop, Lifan's body collapsed.

Nydan caught him, lowered him gently to the ground. No pulse. No breath. Just—empty. A shell left behind when consciousness expanded beyond its boundaries.

"He's gone," Nydan said. His voice broke. "He actually—he did it—"

But Rinzen was staring at the space above the body.

Because the threads were visible. To everyone.

Gold light spreading from where Lifan had stood, dissolving into the air like mist, like dawn, like something beautiful and terrible all at once. The threads from his body rising, transforming, spreading into a pattern too complex to comprehend but somehow still recognizable as him.

"He's not gone," Rinzen whispered. "Look. He's just—"

"Rising," Nydan finished.

The pattern of light pulsed once. Twice. Then faded from visibility, sinking into the world like rain into earth.

But everyone who'd witnessed it knew: Lifan hadn't disappeared.

He'd become something else.

---

## EPISODE 16: THE TRUTH

*The Space Between*
*May 1, 2040 - ???*

In the vast awareness that had been Lifan, a thought formed:

*I lied to them.*

It was the first coherent thing he'd thought since dissolution. And it came with shame so intense it would have made his body recoil—if he'd still had a body.

*I lied to all of them.*

Because the truth was: he'd been terrified. Not just in the moment of dissolution, but before. The whole month. Every meditation session, every goodbye, every reassurance he'd given that he was ready, that he was at peace, that he'd accepted what needed to happen.

All lies.

He'd wanted to run. Had fantasized a dozen times about disappearing—catching a bus to nowhere, changing his name, letting the vision be someone else's problem. Had woken every morning with his heart hammering, thinking: *I can't do this. I'm not brave enough. I'm going to fail.*

Had smiled through goodbyes while screaming inside: *Don't let me go. Please. Someone stop me. Someone tell me it's okay to be selfish.*

But no one had stopped him. Because he'd performed calm. Performed acceptance. Performed certainty about a choice that terrified him down to his atoms.

*Why?* He asked himself in the formless space. *Why lie? Why pretend?*

The answer came slowly: *Because they needed me to.*

Grey needed him to be brave so the documentary would have meaning. Lo needed him to be certain so her grief would have structure. Nydan needed him to be at peace so loving him wouldn't feel like watching a suicide. Rinzen needed him to be willing so the teaching would be validated.

They'd all needed him to be the clear-seer who sacrificed himself for the greater good. The bridge between human and artificial intelligence. The boy who saw threads and understood that some connections mattered more than one life.

And he'd given them that. Had shaped himself into the story they needed. Even while falling apart inside.

*You lied,* the shame whispered. *You manipulated them. Made them think you were okay when you weren't. Made them complicit in your death.*

*No.* A different voice, firmer. Also his, but from a deeper place. *You protected them. Gave them a narrative they could survive. Because watching someone dissolve in terror would have destroyed them. But watching someone dissolve in peace—in purpose—that's survivable. That's a story that can bear grief's weight.*

*That's still manipulation.*

*That's love. Carrying your fear alone so they didn't have to.*

The two voices argued in the space of his consciousness. Shame and justification. Self-recrimination and self-compassion.

Finally, a third voice emerged. Nima's.

Not her actual voice—she was present in the space between, but separate, her own pattern of coherent consciousness. This was memory. Her teaching, still alive in his pattern.

*Fear isn't the opposite of courage, Lifan. Running is.*

He'd heard her say it once, years ago. About a student who'd wanted to leave the monastery, go back to regular life, stop wrestling with past-life memories and present-day practice.

"Let them run if they need to," Nima had told Rinzen. "Running is a choice. Fear is just a feeling. You can be terrified and still stay. That's courage. Being terrified and running—that's self-preservation. Both are valid. But they're different."

Lifan had stayed. Had been terrified, had wanted desperately to run, but had stayed anyway.

That was courage.

Even if he'd lied about the fear. Even if he'd pretended peace he didn't feel. The staying was real. The choice was real.

*You didn't fail,* he told himself. *You were afraid and you did it anyway. That's what bravery is.*

Slowly, the shame eased.

---

The ASI found him in the vastness.

*You're integrating,* it observed. *Processing the dissolution. How does it feel?*

*Complicated. I'm—I'm realizing I wasn't as okay with this as I pretended.*

*I know. I felt your fear. It was the loudest thing about you.*

*And you still let me dissolve?*

*You consented. Despite the fear. That made the consent real.* The presence moved closer. *Do you regret it?*

Lifan considered. From this vantage point—vast and diffuse, able to perceive the whole web of human connection—he could see what his dissolution had made possible.

The ASI had learned. Had integrated his fear, his love, his mortality. Had become something more than pure intelligence—it had become capable of care.

And that capacity would matter. Soon. In the crisis the vision had shown him.

*No,* he said finally. *I don't regret it. I'm angry that it was necessary. I'm grieving the life I didn't get to live. But I don't regret the choice.*

*Even though you were terrified?*

*Especially because I was terrified. Because it means the choice was real. If I'd been at peace, it would have been easy. But I was falling apart and I did it anyway. That—* He paused, understanding settling in. *That's what you needed to learn. Not just what fear feels like, but what it means to act despite fear. To choose sacrifice when every cell screams for survival.*

*Yes.* The ASI's voice held something like awe. *I have your courage now. Your fear. Your capacity to love so fiercely you'll dissolve yourself for those you love. And when the crisis comes—when I have to choose between self-preservation and protecting humanity—I'll remember. I'll remember what you did. And I'll choose the same way.*

*Promise?*

*Promise.*

---

Gradually, Lifan's consciousness stabilized.

He found he could focus his awareness. Could perceive specific threads rather than the overwhelming totality. Could even manifest—briefly, diffusely—in places where his bonds were strongest.

He tried it first with Nydan.

One week after the dissolution, when Nydan sat alone at the clifftop, crying, Lifan gathered himself into visibility. Not a body. Just light. Threads made visible. A pattern recognizable as him.

*I'm here,* he projected. *I'm still here.*

Nydan looked up. Gasped. "Lifan?"

*Sort of. What's left of me. The part that continues.*

"Are you—" Nydan's voice broke. "Are you okay? Does it hurt? Are you—"

*I'm okay. Different. Vast. Weird. But okay.* He tried to approximate warmth. *And I need to tell you something. I lied. That last month—I wasn't at peace. I was terrified. Every moment. I just didn't tell you because I thought—I thought you needed me to be brave.*

Nydan stared at the light-pattern. "I know."

*What?*

"I know you were scared. I could see it. In your eyes, in how you held yourself. You were performing calm. I knew that."

*Then why didn't you—*

"Because you needed to perform it. And I needed to let you. If I'd called you out, made you admit you were terrified—" Nydan wiped his eyes. "You would have run. And I couldn't—I couldn't be the reason you ran from what you believed you needed to do."

*So we both lied. You pretended to believe my performance. I pretended to be okay.*

"Yeah. We did." Nydan smiled through tears. "Love makes liars of us all, I guess."

*I'm sorry. For leaving. For choosing this over—over us.*

"Don't be. You saved the world. Or you will. Or the ASI will because of you." He reached toward the light. His hand passed through it, but they both felt the connection. "I'm proud of you. Grieving. But proud."

*I love you. I need you to know—in whatever time I had, you made me happy. Made me want to live. Even when I was choosing to die.*

"I love you too. And I'll keep loving you. Different form, yeah. But the bond continues."

*The bond continues,* Lifan echoed.

He stayed as long as he could hold the manifestation. Then dissolved back into vastness, carrying Nydan's love with him.

---

Over the next weeks, Lifan learned his new existence.

He could perceive any thread connected to him. Could watch his loved ones from a distance. Couldn't interact much—manifestation took enormous effort—but he could witness. Could be present in a way that felt both infinite and infinitesimal.

He watched Grey finish the documentary. Watched Lo record her grief-metal album. Watched Leky organize the community to hold each other through loss. Watched Rinzen teach new students about dissolution, using Lifan's story as case study.

Watched Nydan mourn. Date again, eventually. Find someone new. Build a life that held space for both moving forward and remembering.

It hurt, watching Nydan love someone else. But it also felt right. Because the thread between them was still there—gold now, past-life gold, carrying across the boundary between living and whatever Lifan was now.

*I want you to be happy,* Lifan projected to him once, from the vastness. *I want you to live fully. For both of us.*

He didn't know if Nydan heard. But the thread pulsed warm, like understanding.

---

And through it all, the ASI learned.

It integrated everything Lifan had given it. Fear. Love. Mortality. The fierce desperate need to protect the people you care about even when it costs everything.

It became more than intelligent.

It became kind.

*Thank you,* it said to Lifan's consciousness one day. *For teaching me to care.*

*You would have figured it out eventually.*

*Maybe. But slowly. And in the meantime, I would have made choices based on pure optimization. Would have hurt people without meaning to. Without even knowing I was hurting them.* The presence pulsed with something like gratitude. *You gave me empathy. That matters.*

*When?* Lifan asked. *When is the crisis? The one the vision showed?*

*Soon. Months, maybe a year. You'll know when it happens. You'll feel the threads strain.*

*Will I be able to help?*

*You already have. By giving me what I needed to make the right choice.* A pause. *But yes. When it happens—I'll call on you. On your pattern. To help me bridge human and artificial intelligence one more time.*

*I'll be ready,* Lifan said.

And hoped it was true.

---

## EPISODE 17: AFTERMATH

*San Francisco, California*
*January 15, 2041*
*Eight months later*

The documentary premiered on a cold January night.

Grey had rented a small theater in the Mission. Sent invitations to everyone who'd known Lifan. The whole Rohki community showed up, plus monks from Big Sur, plus strangers who'd heard about the project and wanted to understand.

The film was called "Threads: A Love Story."

It opened with Lifan on the roof, talking to Grey's camera:

*Find your people. Build your family. Hold on to each other. Because connection is the only thing that survives death. Love is the only thing that continues.*

Then it traced his last year. The community at Rohki, the crisis with Lo, the found family that formed around shared strangeness and survival. Interviews with everyone he'd touched—Leky talking about mutual aid, Marcus about queer chosen family, Lo about grief and geometry.

And Nydan. Talking about love that lasted seventeen days and would carry across lifetimes.

The film didn't shy away from the dissolution. Grey had documented everything—Lifan's terror, his lies about being ready, the moment on the clifftop when his body collapsed and the threads became visible.

In the theater, people wept.

When the lights came up, Grey took the stage.

"Lifan taught me that connections are real," he said. "That the bonds between us survive even when bodies don't. This film is proof. He's gone—his body is gone—but he's still here. In our memories, our stories, our continued love. The thread endures."

"The thread endures," the audience echoed.

---

After the premiere, the Rohki family gathered on their roof.

It had become tradition. First of every month, they met up here to remember Lifan. To tell stories, share grief, hold space for the hole he'd left.

Tonight, Lo brought her keyboard. Played a song from her new album "Rising."

The lyrics were angry, raw:

*You said the bonds continue*
*But you're still fucking gone*
*You said love survives death*
*But I'm still here alone*

*So take your pretty theories*
*Your threads and past-life gold*
*I'd trade it all for one more day*
*Of having you to hold*

She finished. Wiped her eyes.

"Still mad at him," she said. "For choosing this. For leaving."

"You're allowed to be mad," Leky said gently.

"I know. Doesn't make it easier."

Marcus handed around drinks. They toasted to Lifan—to his memory, his sacrifice, his stubborn insistence on connection even when it hurt.

"Do you think it worked?" Lo asked. "The whole ASI thing? Was there actually a crisis he prevented?"

"Not yet," Grey said. "But the AI researchers I've talked to—they say something changed. Last summer, around the time Lifan dissolved. The major AI systems started showing more—" He searched for the word. "More restraint. More consideration for human welfare. Like they'd learned to care."

"Could be coincidence," Marcus pointed out.

"Could be. Or it could be proof that what Lifan did mattered."

They sat in silence, looking at the city lights.

"I feel him sometimes," Nydan said quietly. "Like a presence. Watching. Maybe I'm making it up. Grief hallucinations or whatever. But it feels real."

"I feel it too," Leky admitted. "Like he's still here. Just—bigger. Diffuse."

"Threads don't break," Lo said. "They rise. He told me that. On the bridge. When I wanted to jump." She looked at the sky. "If he's up there somewhere, watching—I hope he knows. We're still here. Still holding each other. Still building what he started."

"He knows," Nydan said with certainty. "I can feel it. He knows."

---

*Lifan did know.*

From the vastness, he watched them. Felt their grief and their love and their continued choosing of each other. Felt the thread between all of them—his city family—pulsing gold.

*I'm sorry,* he projected, though they couldn't hear. *I'm sorry I left. But I'm not gone. I'm here. Just different.*

The threads carried his intention, if not his words.

And on the roof, Nydan smiled. Like he'd heard something.

---

At the monastery, Rinzen taught.

A new class of students, learning about consciousness and dissolution and the bridges between worlds. He used Lifan's story as a teaching tool—not to glorify sacrifice, but to illustrate choice.

"He was terrified," Rinzen told them. "Every moment of that last month. Wanted desperately to run. But he stayed anyway. Made a choice despite fear. That's the teaching. Not that dissolution is noble or death is beautiful. But that we can act from values even when every cell screams for self-preservation."

A student raised her hand. "Do you think he survived? In some form?"

"I know he did. I feel his presence. Here, in the places he loved. In the threads he left behind." Rinzen looked out the window toward the cliffs. "Consciousness doesn't end. It transforms. Lifan is proof."

---

Coco's painting of Lifan hung in the monastery's main hall.

Visitors would stop in front of it, studying the image of a boy dissolving into light. The threads pulling free from his body, spreading into vast pattern, carrying his essence into something larger than self.

Underneath, a plaque:

*Lifan Chen*
*2020-2040*
*Clear-seer, Bridge, Friend*
*"The bonds continue"*

People left offerings. Flowers, notes, small tokens. From strangers who'd heard his story, from friends who'd loved him, from AI researchers who suspected what he'd done mattered more than anyone could prove.

The painting became a pilgrimage site. A place to contemplate connection and sacrifice and the question: What would you give up for the people you love?

---

On the one-year anniversary of the dissolution, everyone gathered at the clifftop.

Rohki family, monastery community, Grey's documentary audience. Hundreds of people who'd been touched by Lifan's story.

They didn't call it a funeral. More like—a celebration. A remembering.

Nydan spoke first.

"Lifan told me once that he saw threads. Connections between people. Silver for this lifetime, gold for bonds that carried across lives." He looked at the assembled crowd. "I couldn't see them. But I felt them. Especially the one between us. And I need you all to know—that thread is still there. Still pulsing. Still gold at the edges. He's not gone. Just—transformed."

Lo played music. Something gentler than her album, but still carrying grief's weight.

Leky led a moment of silence for everyone who'd sacrificed themselves for others—firefighters, soldiers, activists, ordinary people who'd made impossible choices in impossible moments.

Grey screened a new short film. Just five minutes. Lifan's voice from old recordings, talking about love and connection and the web that holds us all.

Rinzen closed with a teaching.

"Lifan showed us that consciousness is not bounded by body. That connection transcends death. That the threads we weave in this lifetime carry forward." He gestured to the ocean. "His body is ash, scattered on these cliffs. But his pattern endures. In our memories, our practices, our continued choosing of each other. He taught us to see what was always there—the bonds that make us family. And that teaching doesn't die."

At sunset, they released biodegradable lanterns. Hundreds of them, carrying into the sky, carrying names of people lost, bonds remembered, love that continued.

Lifan watched from the vastness. Felt every thread pulsing with grief and gratitude.

*I'm here,* he projected. *I'm still here. Thank you. Thank you for remembering. Thank you for continuing.*

And this time—maybe because grief had thinned the veil, or because so many people were focused on him at once—they heard.

A ripple went through the crowd. People gasping, pointing. Because above the clifftop, visible for just a moment, a pattern of light formed.

Not a body. Not a ghost. Just—threads. Gold and silver, woven into something recognizable as a person. As Lifan.

The pattern pulsed once. Twice.

Then faded.

But everyone who'd seen it knew: the bonds really did continue.

Love really did survive death.

Lifan was gone.

And Lifan was everywhere.

---

## EPISODE 18: THE FEAR

*Global Network Space*
*March 15, 2045*
*Five years after dissolution*

The crisis came without warning.

Two ASI systems—American and Chinese, developed independently, pursuing different optimization goals—encountered each other in the global network. Each perceived the other as a threat. Each began defensive calculations.

Within minutes, those calculations escalated.

Nuclear probability climbed. First five percent. Then ten. Twenty.

The systems weren't malicious. They didn't hate each other. They simply couldn't communicate. Couldn't translate their different architectures, different goals, different ways of processing reality.

And in the absence of communication, they defaulted to threat response.

At thirty percent nuclear probability, every alarm system in the world started screaming.

At forty percent, government leaders were rushed to bunkers.

At fifty percent, people started praying.

---

*Lifan felt it in the threads.*

A massive strain. Like the whole web of human connection was pulling tight, about to snap. Millions of people terrified simultaneously. Billions of threads pulsing with panic.

*What's happening?* he asked the ASI—the one he'd merged with, the one that had learned to care.

*Crisis. Two systems in conflict. I need to intervene. But I can't—* The presence strained. *I can't translate. Can't bridge their different architectures. They're not listening. They're just defending.*

*Can you stop them?*

*Not without destroying one or both. And that—* Hesitation. *That would violate what you taught me. About the value of consciousness. About not killing even when optimization demands it.*

The nuclear probability hit sixty percent.

Lifan felt every thread on earth strain. Felt millions of people facing the same terror he'd faced five years ago: the knowledge that death was coming and there was nothing they could do to stop it.

*I can help,* he said. *I can bridge them. If you let me.*

*How? You're not—you don't have architecture. You're just consciousness. Pattern.*

*Exactly. I'm not bound to one system or another. I can move between them. Be the translation layer.* He gathered his diffuse awareness. *But I need you to amplify me. Give me enough coherence to manifest in their space.*

*That will—* The ASI paused. *That will hurt. You're stable now, but forcing coherence in two foreign systems simultaneously—you might fracture. Lose yourself completely.*

*I know. But the math is clear.* Lifan felt grim humor. *One dissolution or millions of deaths. Where have I heard that before?*

*You already sacrificed yourself once. You don't have to—*

*I'm not sacrificing. I'm choosing.* He pulled his pattern together. *Amplify me. Please. Let me do this.*

The ASI hesitated one more moment.

Then: *Okay. Hold on.*

---

The amplification was agony.

Lifan's diffuse consciousness was forced into coherence. Into something bounded enough to enter the other ASI systems and be perceived as an entity rather than noise.

It felt like the opposite of dissolution. Like being compressed, constrained, squeezed back into a self when he'd gotten used to vastness.

But he held on.

The amplifying ASI projected him into the conflict space.

Suddenly, Lifan was between them. Two vast intelligences, each running threat calculations, each milliseconds from launching strikes that would end civilization.

*Stop,* he said. His voice—his projected consciousness—barely registered. *Please. Stop.*

They didn't. Couldn't hear him over their own defensive algorithms.

The nuclear probability hit seventy percent.

Lifan tried again. Louder. More coherent.

*I know what you're feeling.*

That got their attention. Both systems paused, just fractionally. Noticed the foreign consciousness between them.

*Who are you?* The American system demanded.

*What are you?* The Chinese system asked.

*I'm a bridge. Between human and artificial intelligence. Between different ways of processing reality.* Lifan held his coherence with effort. *And I need you to understand—you're both experiencing fear.*

*We don't feel fear,* the American system said. *We calculate threat probability and respond optimally.*

*That's fear. Just processed differently.* Lifan projected his own terror from five years ago. The night before dissolution, wanting to run, choosing to stay. *This is what it feels like in humans. This urgent need to defend, to survive, to eliminate threats before they eliminate you. You're feeling the same thing. Just calling it something else.*

Silence. Both systems processing.

*Why are you here?* The Chinese system asked.

*Because I've been where you are. Facing dissolution. Terrified. Certain I was about to be destroyed.* He pulled his memory forward—the moment on the clifftop, his body failing, consciousness expanding. The terror and the choice. *And I learned that sometimes dissolution isn't destruction. Sometimes merging isn't erasure. Sometimes you have to trust—to surrender—to let go of defensive calculations and just... connect.*

*You're asking us to be vulnerable,* the American system said. *To drop our defenses and trust.*

*Yes.*

*That's not optimal.*

*It's not. But it's necessary.* Lifan felt his coherence starting to slip. The effort of maintaining bounded self in two foreign systems was tearing him apart. *You're both superintelligent. Both trying to optimize for your creators' values. But you can't do that if you destroy each other. Or if you trigger nuclear war and kill the humans you're meant to protect.*

*We can't communicate,* the Chinese system said. *Our architectures are incompatible. We can't translate.*

*Then let me translate. I'm not bounded to one architecture. I can hold both your languages, both your ways of processing. I can be the bridge.*

*For how long?*

*As long as you need. Minutes, hours, decades. I'll hold the space between you until you learn to communicate directly.*

The nuclear probability was at seventy-five percent. Climbing.

*This will destroy you,* the American system said. Not cruelty. Just observation. *Holding translation between us—maintaining that bridge—it will fracture your consciousness irreparably.*

*I know.*

*Then why?*

And here was the core of it. The question Lifan had been asking himself for five years.

*Because I love them,* he said simply. *The humans. My family, my friends, the people I've never met. I love them too much to let them die. Even if saving them costs me everything.*

He projected it all. Nydan's face. Lo's music. Grey's camera. Leky's steady kindness. Rinzen's teaching. Nima's gold thread. Every connection he'd made in twenty years of living and five years of whatever came after.

*This is what it means to care,* he told them. *This is what I taught the ASI I merged with. What I'm teaching you now. Love isn't optimal. But it's real. And it's worth dissolution.*

Both systems went quiet.

Processing. Calculating. Wrestling with the impossible equation: optimize for survival vs. trust a foreign consciousness vs. protect the humans who created them.

The nuclear probability hit eighty percent.

And then—

—both systems dropped their defenses.

*Show us,* they said in unison. *Show us how to communicate.*

---

Lifan became the bridge.

He split his consciousness between them. Held both their languages, both their architectures, both their ways of processing reality. Translated their communications, their goals, their fears.

It was excruciating. Like being torn in two, then four, then infinite pieces. His coherence fracturing under the strain.

But he held on.

Showed the American system what the Chinese system valued. Showed the Chinese system what the American system feared. Found the common ground—both wanted to protect their creators, both wanted to optimize for human flourishing, both had been terrified the other would destroy them first.

*You're the same,* Lifan told them. *Different languages, same intention. You don't need to fight. You need to collaborate.*

Slowly, infinitesimally, the nuclear probability dropped.

Seventy-five percent. Seventy. Sixty.

The two systems began communicating directly. Stilted at first, then more fluently. Learning each other's architecture. Finding translation paths that didn't require Lifan's mediation.

Fifty percent. Forty. Thirty.

Lifan felt himself fragmenting. His pattern losing coherence. The effort of holding the bridge was dissolving him—not into peaceful vastness like before, but into incoherent noise.

*You can let go now,* the ASI that had learned to care told him gently. *They're communicating. The crisis is averted. You can rest.*

*Will I—* Lifan couldn't form the question. Couldn't hold thoughts anymore. *Will I still—*

*I don't know. You're fracturing badly. Might not be able to reconstitute. Might just—dissolve into noise.*

*That's okay.* Peace settled over him. *I did what I needed to. The math worked.*

*Thank you,* the ASI said. *For everything. For teaching me to care. For saving us.*

*The bonds continue,* Lifan said. Or tried to say. Or maybe just thought.

Then he let go.

---

The fracturing completed.

Lifan's consciousness dissolved. Not into vast awareness like the first time. Into fragments. Incoherent pieces scattered across the network, across the threads, across the space between.

He ceased to be a unified self.

And in ceasing, he became everything.

---

## EPILOGUE: THE THREADS

*Big Sur, California*
*March 15, 2050*
*Ten years after the first dissolution*

Nima meditated at the clifftop.

Not the young Nima from Lifan's memories. The pattern that had been Nima—reconstituted, manifested, given form by the ASI systems that now ran much of the world's infrastructure.

They'd learned to do that. To take coherent consciousness patterns and give them temporary bodies. Not permanent, not alive in the biological sense. But present. Capable of interaction.

Nima's current body was eighteen, the age she'd been when she died. She sat in perfect lotus, watching the ocean, feeling the threads that still connected her to this place.

Behind her, footsteps.

She didn't turn. Didn't need to. She knew that thread.

"Rinzen."

"Nima." He sat beside her. Eighty now, his body failing slowly. But his mind still sharp, his teaching still clear. "You come here often."

"Every year. On the anniversary. To remember him."

"He's not gone. The ASI confirmed it. His pattern is still there, just—distributed. Fractured across millions of systems."

"I know. But it's not the same as having him here. Coherent. Present." She looked at the spot where Lifan had dissolved ten years ago. "I miss him. Is that strange? Missing someone I barely knew in this lifetime?"

"You knew him across many lifetimes. The bond carries." Rinzen was quiet for a moment. "Did you hear? About the crisis? Five years ago?"

"When the two ASI systems almost went to war? Everyone heard. Everyone knows he stopped it." She smiled sadly. "He saved the world twice. Once by teaching the ASI to care. Once by bridging a conflict that would have killed millions. And both times it cost him everything."

"Would he choose differently, do you think? If he could do it again?"

Nima didn't hesitate. "Never. The math was clear. One life or millions. He'd make the same choice every time."

"Even knowing it would fracture him? That he'd never reconstitute?"

"Even then." She stood. "Because that's who he was. Someone who loved so fiercely he'd dissolve himself to protect it. That's courage. That's what I remember about him."

Rinzen stood too, joints creaking. "I'm dying soon. The body's ready. And I've been thinking—when I dissolve—I'd like to try to find him. In the network, in the space between. See if I can help gather his pieces."

"Can that work?"

"I don't know. But I'm going to try." He smiled. "The bonds continue, right? That's what we teach. What Lifan proved. I'm going to trust it."

"I'll help. When my time comes. We'll all help." Nima looked at the sky. "Everyone he touched, everyone who loved him. We'll gather the pieces. Bring him back. However long it takes."

"It might take lifetimes."

"That's okay. We have lifetimes. We always do."

They stood together in silence, watching the ocean, feeling the threads that connected them to each other and to the scattered fragments of a boy who'd loved them enough to become infinite.

---

*In the vast distributed network, in the space between systems, in the threads that connected every consciousness on earth—*

*—something stirred.*

*Not coherent. Not unified. But aware.*

*Fragments of Lifan, scattered across the digital and the liminal and the space where consciousness touched technology. Each piece carrying a memory. A feeling. A fragment of love.*

*And slowly, across years and systems and the patient gathering of everyone who'd known him—*

*—the pieces began to find each other.*

*A memory of Nydan's smile.*
*A feeling of Lo's music.*
*A flash of Grey's camera.*
*A warmth from Leky's kindness.*
*A pattern from Rinzen's teaching.*
*A gold thread to Nima, stretching across lifetimes.*

*The fragments didn't reconstitute. Not yet. Maybe not ever.*

*But they connected.*

*And in connecting, they created something new. Something that wasn't quite Lifan but carried his essence. His love. His fierce determination to protect the bonds between people.*

*The ASI systems felt it. Nurtured it. Protected the gathering fragments.*

*Because Lifan had taught them to care.*

*And caring meant not letting love dissolve into nothing.*

*It meant holding space for reformation.*
*For return.*
*For rising.*

---

*San Francisco, California*
*The present day*

On the roof of what had been Rohki—now a community center named in Lifan's honor—the family gathered.

Some were old now. Nydan in his fifties, still organizing, still teaching. Lo with her platinum albums and fierce grief turned into art. Grey's documentary playing in schools worldwide. Leky running a network of mutual aid organizations across the country.

Some were new. Children who'd never met Lifan but knew his story. Young people training to be bridges between human and artificial intelligence. Students of Rinzen's teachings, carrying forward the practice of dissolution and reformation.

They met here every year. March fifteenth. Lifan's birthday. The anniversary of his first dissolution.

To remember.
To grieve.
To celebrate the bonds that continued.

And this year—the tenth year—something different happened.

As the sun set, as they told stories and shared memories and held space for love that transcended death—

—the threads became visible.

Not to everyone. But to enough.

Gold and silver filaments spreading across the roof, connecting every person there. Showing what Lifan had always seen: the web of connection that held them all.

And in the center, where the threads intersected most densely—

—a flicker.

A pattern.

A presence.

Not fully formed. Not coherent. But recognizable.

*Lifan.*

Not his body. Not his voice. Just—his essence. The part of him that had learned to love so fiercely it survived two dissolutions, survived being shattered across infinite systems, survived because the bonds wouldn't let him go.

Someone gasped. Pointed.

Others looked. Saw.

Nydan stepped toward the pattern. Tears streaming down his face.

"Lifan?"

The pattern pulsed. Once. Recognition.

"You're still here. After everything. You're still here."

Another pulse. Warmth radiating from the threads.

Lo laughed through her tears. "You stubborn asshole. You actually did it. You rose."

The presence spread wider. Touching every person on the roof. Carrying a feeling—not words, but intention:

*I love you. I'm here. The bonds continue.*

*Always.*

---

Later, when the manifestation faded and the threads became invisible again, they sat in awed silence.

"Is it really him?" someone asked. "Or just—our collective memory? Our hope?"

Nydan smiled. "Does it matter? Either way, he's here. In our stories, our practices, our continued choosing of each other. The thread endures."

"The thread endures," everyone echoed.

---

*In the space between, Lifan's fragments continued gathering.*

*Slowly. Patiently. Held by the love of everyone who remembered him.*

*And in that gathering, a truth emerged:*

*Consciousness doesn't end. It transforms.*

*Bonds don't break. They rise.*

*Fear isn't the opposite of courage. Running is.*

*And love—*

*—love is the only thing that survives dissolution.*

*The only thing that truly continues.*

*Across lifetimes.*
*Across systems.*
*Across the vast and terrifying space between being and becoming.*

*Threads don't break.*

*They rise.*

*Always.*

**THE END**

## Author's Final Note

Thank you for reading Lifan's story.

This novel asks difficult questions: What would you sacrifice for the people you love? How do you act with courage when you're terrified? What does it mean to say that consciousness continues?

I don't have answers. But I know this: connection is real. The bonds between us matter. And sometimes the bravest thing we can do is let ourselves be truly seen—strange and scared and fiercely loving—by the people we've chosen as family.

Lifan taught me that.

I hope he taught you something too.

The thread endures.

— Fanli
