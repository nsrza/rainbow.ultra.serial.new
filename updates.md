### Key Features in Both Versions

- **The Truth Reveal**: Both novels feature the devastating Chapter 21/Episode 16 reveal—Lifan was terrified the whole time, lied about being ready, and screamed in the light where no one could hear
- **Fear Woven Throughout**: Terror isn't just revealed at the end; it's seeded through nightmares, panic moments, and almost-confessions
- **Earned Hope**: The ending is hopeful but not cheap—hope built on honest fear and real courage
- **Content Warnings**: Crisis resources (988 Lifeline, Crisis Text Line) included in both versions
