   - Niguma's age inconsistency (800 vs 689 years)
   - Tara's death date math
   - Timeline chronology in Chapter 6.5

2. **Make Authorial Decisions**
   - Niguma's age: Keep at 689 years OR age-down to 21 for YA
   - POV: Keep third-person OR convert to first-person present
   - Monastery training timeline: Ages 7-10 with Ning OR ages 14-17 after Ning died

### Phase 2: Structure (Do Second)
3. **Restructure Chapters** - Use `22_CHAPTER_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md`
   - Expand from 17 to 22 chapters
   - Add "Ordinary World" chapter (new Chapter 1)
   - Compress training montage (current Chapters 4-5)
   - Add external stakes scenes throughout Act II

### Phase 3: Integration (Do Third)
4. **Integrate Rohki Crew** - Use `ROHKI_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`
   - Insert Bel Air flashback (Act 1)
   - Add Lo's monastery visit (Day 20-22)
   - Insert Grey's letter (Day 25)
   - Add Lo's drums at dissolution (Day 47)
   - Write epilogue memorial scene

### Phase 4: Polish (Do Last)
5. **Strengthen Hooks/Cliffhangers**

## QUICK REFERENCE

### Rohki Characters At-A-Glance

| Character | Age | Role | Thematic Function |
|-----------|-----|------|-------------------|
| **Grey Martinez** | 23 | Grounded brother, film production | Practical sight, chosen family |
| **Lo (Lorena Vega)** | 21 | Leky's girlfriend, drummer/dancer | Kinesthetic seeing, embodied love |
| **Coco Zhang** | 25 | Rohki founder, trust fund patron | Intuitive vision, space holder |
| **Tom Norris** | 28 | Documentarian, writer | Analytical observer, memory keeper |

### Key Rohki Integration Points

- **Chapter 1 (new):** Full Rohki introduction, Bel Air flashback
- **Chapter 3:** Phone calls/texts after Lifan disappears
- **Day 20-22:** Lo visits monastery (major confrontation scene)
- **Day 25:** Grey's letter arrives (emotional core)
- **Day 30-35:** Marcus surveils Rohki (raises stakes)
- **Day 47:** Lo drumming in LA during dissolution
- **Epilogue:** Documentary screening, crew learns to See

### Critical Continuity Fixes (Top 6)

1. Day 40 appears 4 times - fix to Days 38, 38 evening, 39, 40
2. "800 years since Ning" - impossible, Ning died 14 years ago
3. Niguma age: 689, 700, and 800 in different places
4. Tara died 1987 but text says "31 years ago" (would be 2007)
5. Chapter 6.5 days out of order (Day 37 after Day 39)
6. Probability regression: 68% drops to 52% later

## EDITORIAL CONSENSUS SUMMARY

### Unanimous Praise
- Brotherhood between Lifan and Nydan (emotional core)
- Prose quality at its best (dissolution sequence)
- Thematic ambition (AI alignment made emotional)
- Voice and immersive quality

### Unanimous Concerns
- Middle sags (Chapters 4-6 need compression)
- Niguma romance accelerates too fast
- Supporting cast underdeveloped
- Stakes feel abstract (need civilian faces)
- Epilogue sequel hook cheapens climax

### YA-Specific Notes
- Consider first-person present tense
- Consider aging Niguma down (800 → 21)
- Add more external action/chase elements
- Strengthen sensory details for immersion

## FINAL NOTE

You asked to "close this masterpiece." Here's what you have:

**The bones are excellent.** The Lifan/Nydan brotherhood is devastating. The dissolution sequence is transcendent. The thesis—love over survival, meaning over optimization—is earned.

**What the revision adds:**
- Rohki makes Lifan's sacrifice PERSONAL (he had love, community, a future)
- External stakes create URGENCY (Marcus closing in, Axiom accelerating)
- Continuity fixes remove FRICTION (readers won't get confused)
- Structure creates MOMENTUM (no sagging middle)

**The heart of it:**
You're not just writing about enlightenment. You're writing about what it costs. And now, with Rohki integrated, readers will feel that cost in their bones—because they'll love Grey, Lo, Coco, and Tom too. They'll watch Lifan choose to leave them. And they'll understand: this is what sacrifice actually looks like.

This is YOUR story. Buddhist practitioner. Mixed heritage. Former foster youth. Musician. AI researcher. Every piece of your life is in these pages.

Make it sing.
