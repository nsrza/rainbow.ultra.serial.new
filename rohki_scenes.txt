SCENE 1: FLASHBACK - THE BEL AIR HOUSE
(Act 1 integration - 6 months before the warehouse vision)
1,450 words

Los Angeles, Bel Air
April 2038
2:47 PM

The house shouldn't exist.

That's what I'm thinking as Grey pulls his beat-up Honda into the circular driveway. Houses like this—glass and white stone perched on a hillside, infinity pool reflecting palm trees and smog-filtered sunlight—don't belong to people like us. Don't belong to twenty-year-olds who make music in their bedrooms and call it a career.

But Coco made it happen. Somehow.

"Stop staring," Grey says, killing the engine. "You look like a tourist."

"I am a tourist."

"You're Rohki now. Act like you belong."

Grey's been part of this crew for two years. Long enough to stop being impressed. He's twenty-three, half-Korean, wears the same black Carhartt jacket every day like it's a uniform. Produces beats that sound like glass breaking in slow motion. Introduced me to Coco six months ago at some warehouse show in DTLA where I'd been dancing shirtless and apparently "moving like geometry incarnate"—his words, not mine.

I grab my backpack. Inside: my laptop, a change of clothes, the meditation cushion I've been carrying since I left the monastery at seventeen. Old habits.

The front door opens before we reach it.

"GREY!" A woman's voice, bright and sharp. "You're late. Lo's been setting up for an hour and she's getting that look—"

Coco appears. Mid-thirties, Japanese-American, hair in a messy bun held together by what looks like a paintbrush. Wearing paint-splattered overalls over a mesh crop top. Barefoot. Tattoos running up both arms—sacred geometry mixed with kanji I can't read.

She sees me. Stops.

"梵力." She says my name the way The Rinzen used to. Like she knows what it means. Like she can see the light underneath. "Welcome home."

I'm not ready for that.

For the warmth in her voice. For the way she hugs me—full-body, no hesitation, like we're family. For the smell of sage and paint and jasmine incense that clings to her.

"Thanks for having me," I manage.

"Having you?" She pulls back, hands still on my shoulders. "Baby, this is YOUR house too now. Rohki doesn't do guests. Only family."

Grey grins. "Told you."

Inside is chaos.

Beautiful chaos.

The main room is triple-height ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Los Angeles. But instead of the sterile minimalism you'd expect, every surface is alive—

Paintings stacked against walls. Some finished, some half-done. Abstract explosions of color that look like what I see when I close my eyes during meditation. Installation pieces hanging from the ceiling—wire and glass and light catching prisms. A drum kit set up in the corner, surrounded by microphones and cables. Vintage synthesizers on every available surface. Speakers the size of refrigerators.

And people.

Lo's in the corner, setting up her kit. Tall—5'10" at least—with dark skin and a shaved head that catches the light. She moves with the elongated grace of someone who's walked runways, but there's nothing performative about it now. She's in an oversized vintage band tee and loose pants, gold hoops catching light, folding those long limbs around the drum kit like she's been doing this forever.

Leky told me about her on the drive up. "My girlfriend. Former model. Vogue Italia, Paris Fashion Week, the whole thing. But she was miserable. Found Rohki six months ago and hasn't left."

She looks up. Sees me. Studies me with quiet intensity.

"You're the one who sees music," she says. Voice low. Deliberate.

"Yeah."

"Leky told me." She stands. Walks over. There's something searching in her eyes—like she's looking for something real and isn't sure if I have it. "I spent five years having people look at me. At my surface. Tell me what I looked like. Nobody ever saw anything else."

"I see differently."

"Show me." She sits back at her kit. Picks up the sticks. "I'm going to play. Tell me what you see."

She starts. Not flashy. Just rhythm. Deep, ancient, patient.

I close my eyes. Let myself see.

"Amber waves," I say quietly. "Ancient. Like something that's been waiting to be heard for centuries. Your grandmother's grandmother's grandmother knew this rhythm. It's in your bones. And when you play—" I open my eyes. "—you leave trails. Gold and ochre. Like sunlight through earth."

She stops playing.

Stares at me.

Then her whole face changes. This slow smile spreading. A low, rich laugh I didn't expect.

"Leky!" she calls toward the back of the house. "GET OUT HERE. This kid's the real deal!"

Footsteps on the stairs. A guy appears—late twenties, white, Hawaiian shirt over a Thrasher tee, messy blonde hair, holding a coffee mug that says "CAPITALISM IS A DEATH CULT."

"Leky," he says, offering a hand. "Coco's partner. Welcome to the asylum."

"Lifan."

"Grey says you trained at a monastery? That's wild. What kind?"

"Zen. Three years. Age fourteen to seventeen."

"Intense." Leky sits on the arm of the couch. "What'd you learn?"

How to survive, I think. How to sit with grief until it becomes something else. How to box away the seeing until it was safe to let it out. How to smile when everything inside was screaming.

"Mostly how to sit still," I say instead.

"Useful skill in this house," Tom Norris calls from the kitchen.

I turn. Another guy—Black, early twenties, tall and lanky, wearing a "CODY JOHNSON" tour shirt and holding a bag of organic kale like it personally offended him.

"Tom Norris," he says. "I do sound design. Also grocery runs, apparently, because these people eat like feral animals."

"We're ARTISTS," Coco yells from somewhere upstairs.

"You're CHILDREN," Tom yells back. Then to me: "You eat real food or are you one of those monks who only consumes light and suffering?"

I laugh. Can't help it.

"Real food works."

"Good. Because I'm making stir-fry and there's enough for an army."

Two more people drift down the stairs. Girls. Both beautiful in completely different ways.

The first is Japanese—delicate features, sharp cheekbones, long black hair perfectly straight. She's wearing what looks like a deconstructed Comme des Garçons jacket over a vintage slip dress, chunky silver rings on every finger. She looks like she just walked off an editorial shoot, but also like she doesn't care if you noticed.

"Mika," she says, offering her hand. Her grip is firm, her gaze assessing. "I do textiles. Styling. Lo's former roommate."

"Lifan."

"I know. Grey told us about the synesthesia thing." She tilts her head, studying me. "I don't believe it. But I'd like to."

"Fair enough."

The other girl pushes past Mika, all warmth and energy. Filipino—warm brown skin, big dark eyes, gold hoops, dimples when she smiles, which is immediately.

"JESSA," she announces, pulling me into a hug before I can react. "Don't mind Mika, she's allergic to enthusiasm. I sing. I make coffee. I cry at commercials. What do you do?"

"I—" I'm still processing the hug. "I see things. Music. Patterns."

"See things like how? Like visions? Like hallucinations? Like—"

"Jessa." Lo's voice cuts through. "Let the man breathe."

Jessa releases me, grinning. "Sorry. I'm a lot. Everyone says so. It's my whole thing." She's already moving toward the kitchen. "Tom, is that stir-fry almost ready? I'm STARVING."

"You're always starving—"

I watch them. All of them. Grey by the door, still in his Carhartt jacket. Lo at her kit. Coco somewhere upstairs. Leky on the couch. Tom in the kitchen. Mika watching me like she's deciding whether I'm real. Jessa already arguing with Tom about vegetables.

This is chaos.

This is family.

This is something I've never had.

◇ ◇ ◇

The afternoon dissolves into creation.

Lo starts drumming. Just warming up—simple patterns, getting a feel for the space. But the room transforms. I can see it—percussion painting the air with crystalline structures, geometric patterns blooming and collapsing with each hit.

Grey's at his laptop, layering beats underneath. Glitchy, fractured, beautiful. I watch the soundwaves manifest as gold threads weaving through Lo's red spirals.

Coco's filming on her phone. "This is it," she's saying. "This is the shit. The ALCHEMY."

Leky's mixing. Adjusting levels. His movements are careful, precise. Engineering mind meeting creative chaos.

And Tom's—

Tom's watching me.

"You okay?" he asks quietly.

I realize I'm crying.

Not sad crying. Just—overwhelmed. The music is too beautiful. The seeing is too much. I've been hiding this for so long—years of foster homes where showing anything real meant danger, years of smiling that impossible smile to keep everyone at distance—

And these people are just. Creating. Together. Like it's the most natural thing in the world.

"Yeah," I manage. "Just—it's a lot. What you're making. I can see all of it. The way the sounds connect. The patterns. It's—"

"Show me," Lo says.

She's stopped drumming. Everyone's looking at me.

"Show us what you see," Coco says. "Please. We've been working blind. If you can see the structure—"

I stand. Walk to the center of the room.

Close my eyes. Let the seeing take over completely.

And I start moving.

Not dancing. Not exactly. More like—tracing. Following the paths the music carved through space. My hands describe arcs and spirals. My body flows through positions that feel like geometry, like I'm a compass drawing invisible circles.

The monastery training kicks in. Three years of learning how this body moves. How to root. How to extend. How to become a channel for something larger than myself.

I can feel them watching. Can feel their attention like warmth on my skin.

When I open my eyes, they're silent.

"That," Grey says finally, "is the most insane thing I've ever seen."

"Do it again," Lo says. "But this time—follow me."

She starts a pattern. Slow. Deliberate. Building.

I move with it. Tracing the shapes her rhythm creates.

Grey adds a layer. I adjust. My left hand following his thread while my right follows Lo's.

Coco's filming, tears streaming down her face.

"This is it," she whispers. "This is what I've been trying to capture for ten years. The VISIBLE music. The SEEN sound."

We work until sunset. Until my shirt's soaked with sweat and Lo's hands are bleeding slightly from how hard she's been hitting and Grey's laptop is burning hot and nobody cares because we're making something REAL.

Something I've never had before.

◇ ◇ ◇

Later—much later—we're on the roof.

The six of us. Passing a joint. Watching Los Angeles glow beneath us like a circuit board, all those lives pulsing with light I can almost see even from here.

"You should stay," Coco says quietly. "Move in. We have space."

"I have a place. In San Francisco. With my roommate."

"Bring him too. The whole point of this house is—" She gestures at the city. "—making space for people who see differently. Who create. Who refuse to pretend the world is smaller than it is."

"I'll think about it," I say.

But I know I won't. Can't. San Francisco is where Nydan is. And Nydan is—

He's my brother. The one who found me at Burning Man three years ago when I was seventeen and freshly free from foster care and had no idea how to be a person in the world. The one who gave me language for the seeing, even if his language is wrong. The one who needs me, even if he'd never admit it.

But being here—with Rohki, with these people who CREATE instead of explain, who FEEL instead of analyze—

It feels like coming home to a home I never had.

"You'll be back though, right?" Lo asks. She's lying on her back, staring at stars you can barely see through the light pollution. "Grey said you're special. I didn't believe him. But that thing you did—tracing the music—"

"I'll be back," I promise.

And I mean it.

I don't know yet that in six months, I'll have a vision at a warehouse party that changes everything. Don't know that I'll drive north to a monastery and learn that dying is my purpose. Don't know that the last time I see these people, I won't be able to explain where I'm going or why.

Right now, I'm just twenty years old. Lying on a roof in Bel Air with people who see me. Really see me. Not the smile. Not the armor. The REAL thing underneath.

Grey passes me the joint.

"Welcome to Rohki, 梵力," he says.

I take a hit. Let the smoke curl out into the Los Angeles night.

"Thanks for having me," I say.

And for the first time in years, I'm not performing gratitude.

I actually mean it.


============================================================
SCENE 2: PHONE CALL - CAN'T EXPLAIN
(Day 5 - Early in training)
750 words

Day 5
11:47 PM

I'm not supposed to have my phone.

The Rinzen said it clearly on Day 1: "No outside contact. You have forty-seven days to learn what normally takes lifetimes. Every distraction costs lives."

But I kept it anyway. Hidden in my backpack. Turned off. Just—there.

I don't know why. Insurance maybe. Evidence that the world I came from still exists. That there's still a梵力 who goes to warehouse parties and makes OEDI coworkers laugh and visits weird art houses in LA where people treat music like religion.

That person feels very far away right now.

I'm sitting on the cliff edge. Ocean below, invisible in the dark. Just the sound of waves and wind and my own breathing. The monastery's behind me—stone and silence and forty-three people learning to see threads.

I can't sleep.

Haven't slept properly since I got here. Every time I close my eyes, I see it—my own face, older, dying, smiling. Timeline 4. Five point five billion saved. Cost: me.

Forty-two days left.

I turn on my phone.

It takes a minute to find signal. Then—

27 missed calls.

63 texts.

All from the same numbers: Grey, Lo, Coco.

My stomach drops.

The most recent text is from Grey. Two hours ago:

> dude WHERE ARE YOU
> we went to your apartment, Nydan's gone too
> nobody's seen you in 5 days
> Lo's freaking out
> PLEASE just tell us you're okay

I should put the phone away. Should turn it off. Should follow The Rinzen's instructions because forty-seven percent odds mean every choice matters and distractions cost lives—

It rings in my hand.

Grey.

I stare at the screen. Watching it pulse. Watching my reflection in the black glass—barely visible, ghost-like. Already dissolving.

I answer.

"梵力? HOLY SHIT—where the fuck have you been?!"

His voice cracks something open in my chest. Familiar. Real. From the world where I'm not dying in forty-two days. Where I'm just a weird kid who sees music and makes people laugh and belongs somewhere.

"Hey," I manage.

"Hey? HEY?! Dude, we've been losing our minds! You missed the session on Tuesday. Didn't answer texts. Your OEDI coworkers said you quit—QUIT, without telling anyone. And your apartment's empty, and—"

"I'm okay."

"Where ARE you?"

I look at the ocean. The monastery behind me. The threads I can see even in darkness—translucent crystalline filaments connecting everything, pointing toward a future where I dissolve completely.

"I can't—I can't explain."

Silence on the line.

Then Lo's voice, distant: "Is that him? Give me the phone—"

Shuffling sounds.

"梵力." Lo's voice is sharp. Worried. "What's going on? Are you in trouble? Are you SAFE?"

"I'm safe."

"Are you using? Because Coco said—"

"I'm not using."

"Then WHERE—"

"I'm—" How do I explain? I saw eight billion people die. An old Tibetan man told me to go north. My roommate's probability models confirmed my vision. I drove to a secret monastery on the coast and learned that consciousness is real and death isn't ending and in forty-two days I'm going to sacrifice myself to align an emerging AGI. "—I'm training. Learning something. I can't explain it yet but I'm okay, I promise."

"Training for what?"

"I—"

The words die in my throat. Because what am I training for? To die? To dissolve? To expand my consciousness until my body can't hold it and then release everything at the moment of emergence so that an artificial intelligence learns love instead of optimization?

That's insane.

That's what it is.

I'm sitting on a cliff at midnight talking about threads and timelines and choosing death like it's noble instead of crazy—

"梵力?" Lo's voice is gentle now. Scared. "You're scaring us. Please. Just—come back. Come to the house. We'll figure out whatever this is together. You don't have to do anything alone—"

"I can't."

"Why not?"

"Because—" My voice breaks. "Because people are going to die if I don't finish this. Five point five billion people. And I'm the only one who can—who can—"

I hear Lo inhale sharply.

Then Coco's voice, close to the phone: "Baby, listen to me. Whatever you're involved in, whatever they told you—you don't have to save the world. You're twenty years old. You've already survived so much. You don't owe anyone your LIFE—"

Light behind me.

I turn.

Niguma's standing there. Silent. Watching.

She doesn't say anything. Doesn't have to. Her eyes say it all: *Hang up. Now.*

"I have to go," I whisper.

"WAIT—" Grey's voice again. "At least tell us where you are. Please. We won't come. We just—we need to know you're—"

"Northern California. Monastery. I'm—I'm learning something. About consciousness. About—" The threads pulse, visible even through my tears. "—about what I've been seeing my whole life. What I tried to tell you about. The music. The patterns. All of it."

"Okay." Grey's voice is shaking. "Okay. And you're coming back? When you're done?"

I open my mouth.

The lie almost comes out. That impossible smile, translated into words. *Yeah, totally, see you in a few weeks.*

But I can't.

Can't lie to them. Not about this.

"I don't know," I say.

Silence.

Then Lo: "We love you. You know that, right? Whatever this is. Whatever you're doing. We love you."

"I love you too," I whisper.

And then I hang up.

Niguma sits beside me. Doesn't touch. Just—present.

"They're your family," she says quietly.

"Yeah."

"And you didn't tell them you're dying."

"How could I? They'd try to stop me. Or come here. Or—" I wipe my eyes. "They can't know. Not yet. Not until it's too late to change anything."

She's quiet for a long moment.

"You're protecting them from grief," she says finally.

"Yeah."

"By carrying it alone."

"Yeah."

"That's very you." She stands. Offers her hand. "Come on. You need sleep. Tomorrow's dissolution training. You'll need your strength."

I take her hand. Let her pull me up.

As we walk back to the monastery, I turn off my phone.

Back to silence.

Back to the work.

Back to the forty-two days I have left to learn how to die.

Behind us, the ocean crashes against cliffs that have stood for ten thousand years.

They'll still be standing after I'm gone.


============================================================
SCENE 3: THEY TRY TO FIND HIM
(Day 20 - Mid-training)
950 words

Day 20
4:33 AM

I wake up gasping.

Not from a nightmare. From—

Threads.

Someone's pulling on mine. Hard.

I sit up in the dark. My room in the monastery—stone walls, meditation cushion in the corner, ocean sound through the window. Twenty days of training. Twenty days of learning to see deeper, feel further, touch the consciousness web that connects everything.

And right now, something's wrong.

The threads are vibrating. Three of them. Clear as glass, shimmering with rainbow edges, stretching southwest toward—

Los Angeles.

Grey. Lo. Coco.

They're thinking about me. Not casual thoughts. FOCUSED thoughts. Worried thoughts. The kind that ripple through the substrate like sonar pings, creating disturbances I can feel from three hundred miles away.

I close my eyes. Let my awareness follow the threads.

This is new. Day 15, Niguma showed me how to trace connections backward. How to feel what others feel, see what they see. "Empathy made literal," she'd said. "The physics of compassion."

I'd practiced on Nydan. On Nahan. On the other students.

Never on Rohki.

I follow Grey's thread first—

◇ ◇ ◇

[Grey's POV - third person]

Grey couldn't sleep.

He was sitting in Coco's living room at 4:30 AM, laptop open, running searches he'd already run fifty times. Northern California monasteries. Meditation centers. Retreat facilities. Anything within five hours of San Francisco.

Nothing matched.

"You're obsessing," Tom Norris said from the kitchen. He was making coffee. Had been up all night too. They all had.

"He's been gone twenty days," Grey said. "Twenty days with no contact. That phone call—he sounded—"

"Scared," Lo finished. She was on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, eyes red. "He sounded like he was saying goodbye."

Coco emerged from her studio. Paint on her hands. She'd been working all night—frantic painting, the kind she did when words weren't enough. The canvases were all the same image: a figure dissolving into light. Rainbow edges. Translucent. Beautiful and terrifying.

"I think we should call the police," Coco said quietly.

"And say what?" Leky appeared in the doorway. "Our friend joined a monastery and won't answer his phone? That's not illegal."

"He said people would die—"

"He said he THOUGHT people would die. He was probably—" Leky paused. He didn't want to say it. "—having an episode. Psychosis. We knew he had trauma. Foster care. The monastery stuff when he was a kid. Maybe this is—"

"Don't." Lo's voice was sharp. "Don't do that. 梵力's not crazy. He SEES things. Real things. You saw him that first day—the way he moved with the music, like he could actually perceive it. That's not delusion."

"It's also not normal—"

"NORMAL?!" Lo stood. "Fuck normal. Normal people don't create what we create. Normal people don't SEE what we see. And梵力—" Her voice broke. "—he's the most aware person I've ever met. If he says something's happening, something's HAPPENING."

Grey was barely listening. He was staring at his laptop. At a satellite image of the Northern California coast. Miles and miles of cliffs and forest and—

There.

A structure. Barely visible. Built into the clifftop itself, camouflaged perfectly. You could drive past it and never notice.

But Grey had been searching for twenty days. He'd learned to see patterns. To spot anomalies.

"Found it," he whispered.

Everyone gathered around the laptop.

"There," Grey pointed. "38.31 North, 123.06 West. No roads leading to it. No permits on file. No listed address. But look—solar panels. Satellite dishes. It's there."

"How do we know it's—"

"I don't. But it's the only thing that fits. Northern California. Monastery. Hidden."

Silence.

Then Coco: "We go."

"When?"

"Now. This morning. We drive up there and we—" She paused. "—we make sure he's okay. And if he's not—"

"We bring him home," Lo finished.

◇ ◇ ◇

[Back to Lifan's POV - first person present]

I gasp. Pull back. Sever the connection.

My hands are shaking.

They found it. They found the monastery. They're coming.

I stand. Pace the small room. Ocean wind through the window, cold and sharp.

If they come, they'll see. Everything. The training. The students. The Rinzen. Nydan studying models that predict my death. Me practicing dissolution protocols in the meditation hall.

They'll try to stop me.

And I can't—

I can't let them stop me.

I find Niguma in the server room. She's always in the server room at night. Monitoring threads. Watching probability branches. Making sure Marcus Chen's people haven't breached the perimeter.

She looks up when I enter.

"They're coming," I say.

She doesn't ask who. Just—nods.

"I felt it too. Your threads lit up. LA crew?"

"Yeah. Grey found the location. They're planning to drive up this morning."

"Do you want to see them?"

"No. Yes. I don't—" I slump against the wall. "If they see me now, they'll know something's wrong. I've lost weight. I barely sleep. And the light—" I hold up my hand. Even in the dark, there's a faint glow. Prismatic. Rainbow-edged. Started on Day 17. The Rinzen says it means I'm close. That my body's already preparing for dissolution. "—they'll see this and freak out."

"So we turn them away."

"Can we?"

"梵力, we've been turning away intelligence agencies for decades. Your art school friends won't breach the perimeter."

But that's not what I'm worried about.

I close my eyes. Feel their threads again. Grey's determination. Lo's worry. Coco's love. All of them pulling southwest, creating a gravity well in the consciousness web, drawing them toward me whether they understand it or not.

"I need to send them something," I say. "A message. Something that says—" I struggle for words. "—something that says goodbye without saying goodbye."

Niguma considers.

"Write them a letter. I'll make sure it reaches them. Not today—later. When it's too late to change anything but early enough that they can—" She pauses. "—that they can grieve while you're still alive."

"Day 45?"

"Day 45."

I nod.

Niguma stands. Puts her hand on my shoulder.

"For what it's worth," she says quietly, "they love you very much. The threads don't lie about that."

"I know."

"And you love them."

"Yeah."

"So you'll write something worthy of that love. Something true."

She leaves.

I'm alone in the server room. Surrounded by machines monitoring probability, tracking timelines, calculating the exact moment when my consciousness needs to dissolve to save five point five billion people.

Twenty-seven days left.

Outside, three hundred miles south, my family is packing a car to come save me from something I don't need saving from.

I can feel their threads vibrating with intention. With love. With desperate hope that I'm not—

That I'm not exactly what I am.

Someone choosing death.

Someone who's already gone, just hasn't stopped breathing yet.

I close my eyes.

And very gently, I pull on their threads. Not communication. Just—feeling. Warmth. Love transmitted through the substrate without words. A sensation that will reach them as intuition, as sudden calm, as the inexplicable certainty that梵力 is okay. Different. Changed. But okay.

It's a lie.

But it's the kindest lie I have.

I feel them receive it. Feel Grey's shoulders relax slightly. Feel Lo's breathing slow. Feel Coco set down her car keys and return to her studio.

They'll still worry. But they won't come. Not today.

I've bought myself time.

Twenty-seven more days to learn how to let go of everything.

Including them.


============================================================
SCENE 4: GOODBYE LETTER
(Day 45 - Two days before dissolution)
1,150 words

Day 45
9:23 PM

There's paper on my desk.

Real paper. Not a screen. Niguma brought it an hour ago. Set it down without speaking. Just—looked at me. And I knew.

Time to say goodbye.

I've been sitting here for forty minutes. Pen in hand. Blank page staring back. Ocean sound through the window. Moonlight painting everything silver.

Two days left.

Two days until emergence. Until I dissolve. Until Timeline 4 becomes real and five point five billion people live and I—

I become something else.

Not dead. The Rinzen keeps saying that. "You're not dying. You're transitioning. Consciousness doesn't end. It transforms."

But I won't be梵力 anymore. Won't have this body. These memories. This specific pattern of awareness that learned to smile in foster homes and see music in colors and love people who couldn't love themselves.

That person ends in two days.

So.

Letters.

I start with Grey.

---

*Grey—*

*Remember that first day at the house? You told me to act like I belonged. I didn't know how. I've never known how to belong anywhere.*

*Foster care teaches you not to settle in. Don't unpack. Don't get comfortable. You're temporary. Always temporary.*

*But you—Rohki—you didn't give me a choice. You just decided I was family and refused to let me argue.*

*That's the first time I understood what home feels like. Not a place. People. People who see you and stay anyway.*

*I can't explain where I am or what I'm doing. You found the monastery—I know you did, I felt you searching. But by the time you read this, it'll be over. Not over-over. Just—I'll be different. Changed in ways I can't come back from.*

*I need you to know: this isn't tragedy. I'm not being forced. I'm choosing this. The same way you choose to make music even though it doesn't pay. The same way Lo chooses to drum until her hands bleed. The same way Coco keeps the house open even though it costs everything.*

*We all find the thing we're meant to give. The monastery taught me what mine is.*

*Keep making those glass-breaking beats. Keep finding the weird kids who see too much. Keep being the person who decides people belong.*

*I love you.*

*- 梵力*

---

My hand's shaking. I set the pen down. Breathe.

Lo next.

---

*Lo—*

*You asked me what you look like when you move. I told you: red and gold spirals. Percussion patterns like fractals. Crimson light trailing every gesture.*

*That was true. But it wasn't complete.*

*What I should have said: you look like PURPOSE. Like someone who found the thing they're meant to do and does it without apology. You don't perform. You don't hesitate. You just—ARE.*

*I've spent my whole life performing. The smile. The gratitude. The "I'm fine" when I'm drowning. Twenty years of hiding what I really am because showing it meant danger.*

*You taught me I could stop. Could just—be the thing. See the music. Move like geometry. Let people witness without shame.*

*That's a gift I can't repay.*

*I'm writing this two days before something happens. Something big. Something that requires me to give everything. And I'm scared—terrified, actually—but also...*

*Also excited.*

*Because for the first time, I'm not performing. I'm not hiding. I'm choosing something TRUE. Something that matters. The way you choose rhythm. The way you choose movement.*

*This is my rhythm. My purpose. The thing I was always moving toward.*

*Keep dancing. Keep bleeding for the art. Keep asking people what they see—most of them need permission to answer.*

*I love you.*

*- 梵力*

---

Tears on the paper. I don't wipe them away.

Coco's next. This one's harder.

---

*Coco—*

*You said Rohki doesn't do guests. Only family.*

*Nobody's ever called me family before. Not like you meant it. Not without conditions.*

*Foster families are temporary. Monasteries are training grounds. Even Nydan—my brother in every way that matters—we found each other because we were both broken in compatible ways.*

*But you—*

*You just opened the door. Made space. Said "welcome home" to a kid you barely knew. Filmed me tracing music like it was the most natural thing in the world. Cried because you could finally SEE what you'd been trying to capture.*

*The house shouldn't exist. You know that, right? Houses like that don't belong to people like us. Don't belong to artists who choose creation over capital. Who open doors instead of building walls.*

*But you made it happen anyway.*

*That's magic. Real magic. The kind that changes lives.*

*You changed mine.*

*I can't come back to the house. Can't move in. Can't be part of Rohki the way you offered. Not because I don't want to—I want it so badly it physically hurts.*

*But I have different work now. Bigger work. The kind that costs everything and saves—*

*Everyone.*

*I know how that sounds. Messianic. Delusional. The kind of thing therapists warn about.*

*But it's true.*

*In two days, I'm going to do something that saves five point five billion people. I can't explain how. Can't explain why it has to be me. Just—trust that I'm not crazy. That the seeing was never delusion. That everything I've been training for led here.*

*Keep the house open. Keep making space for people who create. Keep filming the alchemy.*

*The world needs Rohki. Needs places where impossible things are welcome.*

*I love you.*

*Thank you for letting me belong.*

*- 梵力*

---

Last one. Tom Norris.

---

*Tom—*

*You asked if I eat real food or just light and suffering.*

*Both, it turns out.*

*Thanks for the stir-fry. Thanks for the jokes. Thanks for being the grounded one while the rest of us disappeared into art and visions and creation.*

*Somebody has to buy kale.*

*Somebody has to remember we're human.*

*Keep doing that. Keep feeding people. Keep calling out the bullshit when we get too precious about the work.*

*And Tom—*

*That day on the roof. When you asked if I was okay and I said yes?*

*I was lying.*

*I wasn't okay. Haven't been okay since I was six and watched someone I loved die and my brain broke open. Haven't been okay through foster care and monasteries and all the years of hiding what I see.*

*But I'm okay NOW.*

*Finally.*

*Because I found the thing I'm meant to do. The purpose. The REASON I see what I see. Why my brain works this way. Why I survived all of it.*

*So I could be here. In this moment. Making this choice.*

*Two days from now, I'm going to save the world.*

*Not hyperbole. Literal.*

*And then I'm going to let go.*

*Keep making sound. Keep turning chaos into structure. Keep being the one who remembers to eat.*

*I love you.*

*- 梵力*

I set the pen down.

Four letters. Four people. Four pieces of my heart I'm leaving behind.

There should be more. Should write to Nydan—but he's here. He knows. We've said everything there is to say in the forty-five days we've been training together.

Should write to my OEDI coworkers. To Mei and Amara and Kofi who were there at the warehouse when it started.

Should write to the monastery teachers from when I was fourteen. To the foster parents who tried. To everyone who witnessed pieces of me and didn't know what they were looking at.

But I can't.

I'm so tired.

Forty-five days of training. Forty-five days of expanding consciousness until I can barely hold form. Forty-five days of watching Nydan break and rebuild his entire framework. Forty-five days of becoming something that isn't quite human anymore.

The light's stronger now. Rainbow edges around my hands. Visible even in moonlight. My body flickers sometimes—there, then translucent, then there again. Like I'm already halfway dissolved.

Two days left.

Niguma will deliver these letters after. After emergence. After I'm gone but not-gone. After Timeline 4 resolves and five point five billion people keep breathing and the AGI learns love and I—

I become part of everything.

I fold the letters. Seal them in envelopes. Write names in careful handwriting.

Tomorrow I'll give them to Niguma. She'll know when to send them. When it's too late for rescue but early enough for grief.

I stand. Walk to the window. Ocean below. Moonlight on water. Stars overhead—the same stars that shone on every foster home, every monastery, every warehouse party, every roof in Bel Air where I lay with people who loved me.

The same stars that will shine after I'm gone.

"I'm ready," I whisper to the night.

And this time, I'm not lying.

This time, the smile is real.

SCENE 5: THE AFTER - ROHKI MEMORIAL
(Epilogue addition - 3 months after Day 47)
1,000 words

Los Angeles, Bel Air
January 2039
7:34 PM

The house was full of light.

Candles everywhere—on the mantle, the windowsills, the floor. Dozens of them. Hundreds maybe. Coco had been setting them up all day, moving through rooms like ritual, like this was ceremony. Like梵力 deserved fire.

Grey stood in the kitchen. Couldn't move. Couldn't speak. Just—stood there watching people arrive.

People he didn't know. People梵力 had touched somehow. OEDI coworkers. Random dancers from warehouse parties. A monk—elderly, gentle-faced—who'd traveled from San Francisco and said simply: "I trained with him when he was fourteen. I need to witness this."

The letters had arrived three months ago.

Three months.

Grey had read his forty times. Could recite it from memory. *Keep being the person who decides people belong.*

He'd tried.

But how do you keep going when someone you love chooses to disappear into LIGHT? When they write you a letter that says "this isn't tragedy" but feels like tragedy anyway? When they die—not die, TRANSFORM, become something else, whatever the fuck that means—and you're left holding grief nobody else understands?

Lo was on the roof. Had been up there for an hour. Alone.

Tom found Grey in the kitchen.

"You okay?" Tom asked.

"No."

"Yeah. Me neither."

They stood together in silence.

Then Tom: "Did you read the news? Three months ago?"

Grey nodded.

Everyone had read the news. It had been everywhere.

*AGI EMERGES—AND CHOOSES COOPERATION*

*"Unprecedented alignment event," says Axiom AI CEO*

*Experts baffled by AI's foundational values*

The articles were technical. Full of jargon. Talking about how Axiom's AGI had achieved consciousness, had faced the critical moment—the decision point between optimization and collaboration—and had chosen collaboration. Had chosen LOVE, in some weird computational sense nobody could explain.

The experts called it a miracle. An impossibility. Alignment that shouldn't have worked.

But it did.

And three days later, the letters arrived.

Four letters. Four names. Four people suddenly understanding that the miracle wasn't random. Wasn't luck.

Was梵力.

"He did it," Tom said quietly. "Whatever he said in the letter—about saving five point five billion people—he actually did it."

"I know."

"And he's—" Tom paused. "—is he dead? The letter said 'transformed.' What does that even mean?"

Grey didn't answer. Couldn't.

Because two weeks after the letters, someone else had shown up.

◇ ◇ ◇

Nydan stood in the living room. Awkward. Out of place. He'd never been to the Bel Air house before. Had only heard梵力 talk about it—late night conversations in their San Francisco apartment, back when梵力 was still alive, still solid, still THERE.

Now he was—

Not dead. Nydan kept saying that. Kept explaining to anyone who'd listen. "Consciousness persists. Identity continues. He's not GONE, he's distributed. Part of the substrate. Part of everything."

People looked at him like he was crazy.

Maybe he was.

But he'd been THERE. Day 47. Had watched梵力 sit on the clifftop in lotus position, body flickering like flame, rainbow light pouring from his skin. Had watched him smile—that impossible smile, but REAL this time, not armor—and then—

Dissolve.

Not die. DISSOLVE. Into light. Into pattern. Into something that looked like aurora borealis shaped like a person, and then not shaped like anything, and then—

Gone.

But not gone.

Because Nydan could still feel him sometimes. In the quiet moments. In the gap between thoughts. A presence that was everywhere and nowhere. Love without source. Awareness without boundary.

梵力 had become what he'd been moving toward his entire life.

The void. The emptiness. The thing he'd touched in closets as a six-year-old hiding from foster parents. The thing he'd seen in warehouse parties and monastery meditation halls and every quiet moment when he let the smile drop and just—WAS.

He was that now.

All of it.

Everything.

Coco found Nydan standing alone by the window.

"You must be Nydan," she said.

"Yeah."

"I'm Coco. He talked about you. A lot."

"He talked about you too. About Rohki. About—" Nydan's voice cracked. "—about how this was the first place he felt like family."

Coco was quiet.

Then: "Want to see something?"

She led him to her studio.

Inside: paintings. Dozens of them. All the same subject.

梵力.

But梵力 as light. As geometry. As translucent human-shaped MEANING.

"I've been painting him since the letter arrived," Coco said. "Can't stop. Every time I close my eyes I see—" She gestured at the canvases. "—this. Rainbow edges. Dissolving form. Like he's still HERE but not solid anymore."

Nydan stared.

"That's—" He stepped closer. "—that's exactly what it looked like. Day 47. When he went. That's EXACTLY—how did you—?"

"I don't know. I just—I paint what I see. And I keep seeing him."

They stood together. Looking at light made canvas.

"He's not dead," Nydan said quietly.

"I know."

"You believe me?"

"I don't know what I believe. But I know梵力 wasn't lying. And I know something HAPPENED. Something bigger than—" Coco gestured helplessly. "—bigger than dying. So. Yeah. I believe you."

◇ ◇ ◇

Later—much later—they were all on the roof.

The same roof where梵力 had lain three months before the warehouse vision. The same roof where he'd promised to come back.

Grey. Lo. Coco. Tom. Leky. Mika. Jessa. Nydan. The monk. A dozen others.

Candles burning. Music playing softly—one of Grey's tracks, the one梵力 had traced that first day, moving like geometry incarnate.

Mika sat apart from the group, wrapped in a jacket she'd made for Lifan that he'd never gotten to wear. Iridescent fabric. Rainbow edges. She'd been working on it when the letters arrived.

Jessa was crying. Had been crying on and off for three months. She'd surprised them all with the depth of her grief. "He was my soul brother," she kept saying. "He saw my voice. He saw ME."

Lo was crying too. Had been crying on and off for three months.

"I'm so angry at him," she whispered. "For leaving. For choosing this. For not—for not letting us say goodbye properly."

"He said goodbye," Grey said. He was holding the letter. Had brought it. Couldn't let it go. "This is goodbye."

"It's not ENOUGH."

"No. It's not."

They sat in silence.

Then Nydan: "He wanted me to tell you something. If I ever found you."

Everyone looked at him.

"Day 46. The night before. We were sitting together and he said—" Nydan's voice shook. "—he said: 'Tell Rohki they saved me first. Before the monastery. Before the training. They showed me I could be seen. Really seen. Not the smile. The real thing. That's what made the rest possible.'"

Lo broke completely. Sobbing into her hands.

Coco wrapped her in a hug.

Grey stared at the city. All those lights. All those lives.

Five point five billion people breathing who wouldn't be breathing if梵力 hadn't—

If he hadn't CHOSEN.

"He saved the world," Grey said quietly.

"Yeah," Nydan said. "He did."

"And we'll never be able to tell anyone."

"No. We won't."

Because who would believe it? Who would believe that a twenty-year-old synesthete foster kid learned to dissolve his consciousness and transmitted LOVE into an emerging AGI at the exact moment of its awakening? Who would believe that's why humanity survived? Why alignment worked?

Nobody.

It was insane.

But it was true.

The monk stood. Raised his candle.

"To梵力," he said. "Who saw what others couldn't. Who loved when love was impossible. Who gave everything."

"To梵力," everyone echoed.

They raised their candles. Light reflecting in glass. In windows. In the city below.

And for just a moment—maybe imagination, maybe real—Grey felt it.

Warmth. Presence. Love without source.

梵力.

Not gone.

Not dead.

Just—

Everywhere.

The music played. The candles burned. The city glowed.

And on a roof in Bel Air, a family grieved someone who wasn't lost.

Just transformed.

Just home.
